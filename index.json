Download Merger-Detailed-Guide (PDF) Download Anatomy-of-an-MA Introduction # This guide provides a high-level outline of the steps and documentation involved in a simple, vanilla transaction under English law to acquire a private company (the “Transaction”). An indicative timeline of the various stages of the Transaction is set out in Appendix 1.\nThis guide assumes that the Transaction involves a single, private, corporate buyer (the “Buyer”) and a single, private, corporate seller (the “Seller”), and that the target company or business (the “Target”) is wholly owned by the Seller.\nThis guide focuses on a sale of shares of the Target, rather than a sale of the businesses or assets of the Target or an investment alongside other (new or existing) shareholders, or joint venture arrangements.\nIn particular, this guide considers four key areas of the Transaction:\nthe pre-contract period (including the non-disclosure agreement, term sheet, exclusivity agreement and due diligence process); the key legal documentation of the Transaction (i.e. the share purchase agreement or business/asset purchase agreement, the disclosure letter and the guarantee); signing and completion of the Transaction; and other considerations such as finance, antitrust, employment and tax. Pre-Contract Period # Non-Disclosure Agreement # A non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) (also referred to as a “confidentiality agreement”), is an agreement between the Buyer and the Seller that may be entered into during the early phases of the Transaction. Proprietary and confidential information often needs to be shared between the parties to a Transaction. The purpose of an NDA is to restrict the receiving party from disclosing such information (and the existence of the negotiations and any deal terms) to unauthorised third\nparties, or from using it for unauthorised purposes or in a manner that would adversely affect the disclosing party.\nNDAs can be unilateral (where there is a one-way exchange of confidential information) or mutual (where there is a two-way exchange of confidential information, for example, where both sides are disclosing information to each other, as might be the case if all or part of the consideration is shares in the Buyer).\nIn negotiating a typical NDA, the Buyer and Seller will need to consider, among other matters:\nDefinition of “Confidential Information”: The disclosing party will want to cast a wide net over what is considered to be confidential (to avoid any gaps or loopholes), whereas the receiving party will want the definition to be as narrow as possible (to provide certainty of what does and does not constitute confidential information for which they are responsible). Parties to the NDA/possible “recipients”: Disclosure to additional persons (other than the Seller and the Buyer) may be required for the purposes of the Transaction, including to subsidiaries, directors, employees and third parties such as legal and other professional advisers and providers of debt finance. Sometimes the NDA will require the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, to be liable for any confidentiality breaches by such additional recipients; other times, the additional recipients may need to be bound directly by the NDA or similar confidentiality obligations. Exceptions: NDAs commonly expressly exclude certain information and disclosures from the confidentiality obligations, i.e. where it would be inappropriate or unreasonable to expect the recipient to keep the information confidential. These exceptions may include information that is: (i) already in the public domain; (ii) already known by the recipient; or (iii) received from a third party where that third party was not obliged to keep the information confidential in the first place. An NDA is also likely to permit the recipient to disclose information in accordance with applicable law or stock exchange rules, or as required by a court, tribunal or regulatory authority. Term Sheet # Before preparing the key Transaction documentation (see Section B (Legal Documentation) below), the Buyer and the Seller will often enter into a term sheet (also known as “heads of terms”, a “memorandum of understanding” or a “letter of intent”). This document is normally only a few pages long and may typically include:\nan outline of the key commercial terms and principles that have been agreed between the parties (e.g. price and approach to valuation, conditions to the Transaction and the shares/business/assets being acquired); a proposed timeline for the Transaction, and a description of the process (for example, the level of due diligence access to be provided to the Buyer); an indication of outstanding matters that will need to be negotiated and addressed in the key Transaction documentation (e.g. “customary warranties”); and exclusivity provisions (whereby the Seller agrees not to sell or market the Target to any person other than the Buyer for an agreed period) and confidentiality provisions (whereby the parties agree to keep the Transaction and the term sheet confidential) - also see Section A(1) (Non-Disclosure Agreement) above and Section A(3) (Exclusivity Agreement) below). Term sheets governed by English law are usually expressed to be “subject to contract” and non-legally binding (save in respect of exclusivity and confidentiality), and act as a framework for negotiation and drafting of legal documentation. Term sheets can provide clarity in complex transactions. While the parties are not obliged to follow the term sheet and have flexibility to change the terms as negotiations progress (e.g. in light of any due diligence), the term sheet is often seen as having moral weight; it shows the intention of the parties, and may make it more difficult for a party to argue a “re-trade” of the deal at a later date. The Buyer may also seek a costs indemnity or break fee in the event the Seller withdraws from negotiations or otherwise breaches, for example, the exclusivity provisions – legal advice should always be sought for such provisions, as they risk being unenforceable.\nExclusivity Agreement # If not covered in a term sheet, a separate exclusivity agreement may also be entered into between the Seller and the Buyer to prevent the Seller from concluding a transaction or pursuing negotiations with, or soliciting interest from, alternative buyers during a fixed period of time. Completing a Transaction can be an expensive and time- consuming process, which can distract the Buyer’s management and employees from their “day jobs”. Before committing time and resources to due diligence and negotiations, a Buyer will want some comfort that the Seller is not trying to sell the Target to someone else at the same time. This is especially the case when the Transaction is conducted as a unilateral (i.e. non-competitive or auction) process.\nThe exclusivity agreement would not, however, commit either party to proceed with the Transaction, and the Seller could sell to a third party at the end of the agreed exclusivity period. Furthermore, the Seller will typically insist that the exclusivity period is no longer than is reasonably required to complete negotiations and due diligence. While parties often extend the exclusivity period if satisfactory progress is being made, it is also common to see provisions whereby the Seller can terminate exclusivity if the Buyer is not making sufficient progress. The Seller would also want appropriate carve- outs from the exclusivity restrictions to allow ordinary course activities.\nDue Diligence Process and Report # Due diligence refers to the Buyer’s investigation of the Target, to gain a better understanding of the Target’s business, to identify potential issues or “red flags” that might impact the valuation of the Target or the benefits of the Transaction, and to reduce the Buyer’s risk profile. Any issues raised during due diligence may be addressed in the legal documentation, but ultimately the Buyer’s decision to proceed\nwith the Transaction (and at what valuation) may depend on the results of the due diligence exercise.\nKey aspects of a due diligence exercise include:\nTiming: Depending on the complexity of the Target and its business (and the commercial drivers of the Transaction), the due diligence process could last from a couple of weeks to several months. Areas of review: In addition to the Buyer’s internal teams (e.g. operational teams) conducting their own analysis of the Target, the Buyer will usually engage various specialists to conduct due diligence. These specialists usually include finance, tax and legal professionals, but additional specialists may be required depending on the Target’s industry (e.g. valuation specialists for a real estate business, environmental experts for businesses that have production operations, etc.). In a typical Transaction, the legal due diligence exercise would focus on information and documents relating to:\ncorporate history and records; shares, securities and shareholders; financing, indebtedness and security; assets and services; material contracts and arrangements; litigation and disputes; employees, employee benefits and pensions; data protection, intellectual property rights and information technology infrastructure and security; real estate; insurance; regulatory compliance; and requirements for regulatory filings (e.g. antitrust filings, etc.). Data room: The Seller will typically set up an online virtual data room to store, and control access to, the information and documents being disclosed about the Target. The Buyer may also seek to schedule conference calls or meetings with the management team of the Target to discuss key areas of due diligence or any issues raised. Report: Usually the Buyer’s advisers will provide due diligence reports to the Buyer, identifying issues that were discovered during the course of the due diligence process. Depending on timing and budget, such reports can be high level, “red flag” reports of key issues only, or more detailed reports about the Target. Identified risks: Issues and risks identified through the due diligence process may be addressed, for example, by: (i) adjustments to the purchase price; (ii) negotiating appropriate warranties and indemnities in the purchase agreement (see Section B(1) (Transaction Agreement) below); (iii) the Seller agreeing to “fix” certain issues either before or after the parties enter into the purchase agreement; or (iv) in extreme circumstances, the Buyer walking away from the Transaction. Legal Documentation # Transaction Agreement # Depending on the form of the Transaction (i.e. whether it is a share sale or a business/asset sale, and if there is a “primary” element of new shares being issued), the key agreement that forms the backbone of the Transaction will usually be one of the following (each a “Transaction Agreement”):\na share sale and purchase agreement; an asset purchase agreement; or an investment/subscription agreement. The first two types of agreement are used where there is a transfer of ownership of shares or other assets; the last type of agreement is used where there is an investment alongside existing or new shareholders or in combination with a share sale.\nThe key components of each type of Transaction Agreement are relatively similar, and include:\nSale and purchase: Each type of agreement will have a clause that deals with the actual purchase of shares/assets or subscription for shares. This clause is focused on ensuring that the Buyer acquires the legal and beneficial interest in the relevant shares or assets. Consideration: This clause deals with the purchase price of the shares/assets, including the amount, form and timing of payment(s), and any adjustments to the purchase price. While payment is usually made in cash, it could also be made “in kind”. For instance, the Buyer might settle all or part of the consideration by issuing its own shares to the Seller.\nIn terms of timing, payment for the shares/assets can most simply be made in full at the time the shares/assets are transferred to the Buyer. Alternatively, other common payment mechanisms include:\nRetention amounts: The Buyer may withhold part of the payment amount for a period of time to later set off against, for example, any warranty claims payable by the Seller (see below). Retained amounts are sometimes held in a third party escrow account. Deferred consideration: The Buyer may want to split the consideration so that a portion is paid at the time of the share/asset transfer, and other portions are paid on later dates (sometimes subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions or steps). Deposits: If the transfer of shares/assets does not take place at the time the Transaction Agreement is signed, the Seller may require the Buyer to pay a portion of the consideration amount upfront as a deposit and pay the rest at the time the transfer completes. Earn-outs: To incentivise, for example, management Sellers who remain employees of the Target, additional amounts of consideration could be paid at a later date subject to the satisfaction by the Target of certain performance criteria. Completion adjustments: The amount of the purchase price may also be adjusted following completion of the Transaction, depending on how the value of the Target has been calculated and agreed. For example, if the value of the Target is based on a set of financial accounts as of a date prior to the share/asset transfer, there may be a later true-up exercise on the basis of financial accounts drawn up as of the time of completion of the transfer (often referred to as “completion accounts”). It is common for the Target to be valued on a “debt free/cash free” basis (i.e. on the basis that all debt is paid off and all excess cash extracted prior to completion), and then for a debt/working capital adjustment to take place through the “completion accounts” mechanism. On the other hand, if the value of the Target is calculated using a “locked box” mechanism (i.e. when the value is fixed prior to signing and the Target is restricted from making certain payments or “leaking” value following a particular date – most typically, the date of the last relevant accounts), the Seller may need to make payments to the Buyer if any payments are made in breach of the leakage restrictions.\nConditions: Sometimes, the parties will not want, or be able, to proceed to complete the Transaction at the time the Transaction Agreement is signed, but for deal certainty will nevertheless want to enter into the agreement. In these instances, the Transaction Agreement may include conditions that must be satisfied before completion of the Transaction can take place. Examples of common conditions include: Antitrust: If there is an overlap in the businesses carried on by the Buyer and the Target, the parties may need to obtain merger control or antitrust clearances from the Competition and Markets Authority (or other antitrust regulators) (see Section E(2) (Antitrust) below). Regulatory or other third party consents: If the Target is regulated by a governmental authority, the Transaction may require the regulator’s consent. Reorganisation: The Buyer may require the Target to carry out an internal reorganisation before it proceeds to completion, which could include simplifying the Target’s group structure, moving unwanted assets to the Seller or moving required assets (including required intellectual property rights) into the Target. Financing: The Buyer may need to obtain third party funding before it can proceed with the Transaction. Other consents: The Target may be subject to commercial or other agreements which require the consent of a third party in the event of a change of control of the Target - such as lenders to the Target (under loan documents) or joint venture partners (under any shareholder agreements). Warranties and indemnities: Warranties are contractual statements of fact in the Transaction Agreement about a particular state of affairs in the Target and its group, or the respective parties, as the case may be. The parties will usually give mutual warranties in respect of their capacity and authority to enter into, and perform their obligations under, the Transaction Agreement. In addition, the Seller will usually give warranties in respect of its title to the Target’s shares, and the Target’s businesses and tax situation. There are two key purposes for the warranties given by the Seller:\nto give the Buyer the right to bring a claim in damages for breach of contract if the warranties turn out to be false and the Target was, as a consequence, not as valuable as anticipated; and to encourage the Seller to disclose information about the Target, its group and businesses, as the Seller’s liability will normally be limited if it discloses information that is inconsistent with the warranties before the parties sign the Transaction Agreement (see Section B(2) (Disclosure Letter) below). If the Buyer becomes aware of a specific risk or issue before it enters into the Transaction Agreement, it may seek an indemnity from the Seller. An indemnity is, in essence, a promise by the Seller to pay to the Buyer an amount equal to (on a pound-for-pound basis) the loss suffered as a result of the specific risk/issue (by way of example, if the Target is the subject of an ongoing specific litigation). This is because the Buyer will be unable to bring a claim under the warranties (or its chances of bringing a successful claim may be limited) if such risk/issue is disclosed to or known by the Buyer before signing the Transaction Agreement.\nDispute resolution: The parties will need to agree the governing law of the Transaction Agreement and the method for resolving any disputes under the Transaction Agreement (including its validity and enforceability), e.g. whether the parties will go to court or use arbitration, and which jurisdiction or arbitration forum and rules will be used. Other key provisions: Other key provisions in the Transaction Agreement may include: Gap controls: If there is a period of time between signing the Transaction Agreement and completion of the Transaction, the Seller will usually give some comfort to the Buyer that the Target’s business will be run in the ordinary course and that certain key actions will not be undertaken without the Buyer’s consent. See Section C(3) (Business Protections) below for further details. Non-compete/non-solicit obligations: The Seller may agree not to compete with the business of the Target or poach key employees for a period following completion of the Transaction. Limitations of Seller liability: The Seller’s liability under the Transaction Agreement may be limited by, for example, monetary caps and timing requirements for the Buyer to bring claims. Termination provisions: The parties are likely to want to set out the circumstances in which either party can terminate the Transaction Agreement, particularly if there is a gap between signing and completion (e.g. if a material adverse change occurs). Boilerplate: Boilerplate is the term given to certain fairly standard clauses in the Transaction Agreement that are not generally considered to be commercial terms, and which have essentially a mechanical legal function. These clauses are not typically the subject of much negotiation between the parties, but can have a significant impact on the agreement. Key examples of boilerplate provisions include the following:\nconfidentiality obligations and requirements for public announcements about the Transaction; the procedure for giving notices under the Transaction Agreement; whether variations of the Transaction Agreement need to be in writing signed by each party, and whether waivers need to be in writing signed by the party giving the waiver; whether parties can assign their rights under the Transaction Agreement to third parties; whether any third parties have any rights under the Transaction Agreement; confirmation that the Transaction Agreement supersedes any prior discussions or other documents or arrangements in relation to the Transaction; and what happens if any of the provisions of the Transaction Agreement are unenforceable at law. Disclosure Letter # In the disclosure letter, the Seller discloses facts which might make any of the warranties contained in the Transaction Agreement untrue. If the disclosure meets the required test for disclosure in the Transaction Agreement (e.g. fair disclosure with sufficient detail to identify the nature and scope of the matter disclosed), the Seller may avoid liability for the ostensible “breach” of warranty. As discussed in Section B(1) (Transaction Agreement) above, a breach of warranty might give the Buyer a right to bring a claim in contract against the Seller. It is, therefore, critical for both the Buyer and the Seller to review the disclosures in detail: from the Seller’s point of view, a poorly drafted disclosure may still result in a claim for breach of warranty; from the Buyer’s point of view, a failure to review the disclosures may mean the Buyer loses the opportunity to address an issue that has been flagged to it in circumstances where it may also be unable to bring a successful warranty claim due to its deemed knowledge of the issue.\nThe Seller typically produces the first draft of the disclosure letter. There are three key elements to the disclosure letter: (i) the general disclosures (the “front-end”); (ii) the specific disclosures (the “back-end”); and (iii) the disclosure bundle.\nGeneral disclosures: The Seller will typically draft the general disclosures to be as broad as possible. These will usually include, for example, disclosures of all information which is available in specified public registers (e.g. for a UK company, the public register at Companies House). In the UK, it is also common for the contents of any virtual data room to be generally disclosed (provided the virtual data room is reasonably well organised with an index). However, the Buyer should be careful to ensure that the disclosures are not so broad that they become unreasonable. For example, when conducting searches of public registers, it is common practice to specify the register as at a specific time and date. Specific disclosures: These disclosures refer to specific, identified matters which, if not disclosed by the Seller, could result in a breach of warranty claim. The specific disclosures typically cross-refer to the relevant warranties in the Transaction Agreement. For example, if the warranty states that the Target is not a party to any legal proceedings, but in fact it is a party to legal proceedings, there should be a specific disclosure about such legal proceedings. Disclosure bundle: The disclosure bundle contains documents which have been disclosed in the disclosure letter, and is generally attached to the disclosure letter. It is commonly provided by way of an exchange of an external hard drive or USB stick, or other electronic file transfer, containing the contents of any virtual data room or other disclosure materials. Two copies of the bundle are made: one for the Buyer and one for the Seller. The parties’ lawyers should ensure that the two bundles contain identical documents, usually by reference to an agreed index.\nThe Seller usually delivers the disclosure letter and disclosure bundle at (or before) the signing of the Transaction Agreement (i.e. when the relevant warranties are given).\nIf there is a gap between signing and completion of the Transaction, the Buyer may seek to have the agreed warranties repeated at completion, so as to get comfort that no material issues have arisen in relation to the Target in the interim period. In return, the Seller would seek to update its disclosure letter, or else it runs the risk of breaching a warranty at completion. As the Buyer will not want to be forced to complete the Transaction if a significant issue arises in a supplemental disclosure letter, the parties often compromise and agree that: (i) the Seller can only make supplemental disclosures relating to new matters which have arisen between signing and completion; and (ii) the Buyer can terminate the Transaction if a supplemental disclosure is made which would constitute a material breach of warranty had it not been disclosed.\nGuarantees # If a party has concerns about the other party\u0026rsquo;s ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Agreement (e.g. the Buyer’s ability to pay the purchase price or the Seller’s ability to meet its liabilities in connection with any potential warranty or indemnity claims), the concerned party will often request that a third party with standing (e.g. the other party’s parent company or key shareholder) guarantee the performance of such obligations.\nGuarantees can be included as part of the Transaction Agreement or exist as a standalone document. However, there are certain legal formalities that need to be observed for a guarantee to be enforceable, including that the guarantee (i.e. the Transaction Agreement if the guarantee is included in the Transaction Agreement) must be executed as a deed.\nSigning and Completion # Split or Simultaneous Signing and Completion # Signing (also referred to as “execution”) occurs when the parties to the Transaction Agreement sign and date the agreement, such that the Transaction Agreement comes into force.\nCompletion (also referred to as “closing”) occurs when the Transaction completes (or closes), which is usually when title to the relevant shares/assets passes to the Buyer (or in the case of a subscription for new shares, when the relevant shares are issued to the Buyer) and the Buyer pays the consideration.\nAs discussed above in Section B(1) (Transaction Agreement), signing and completion can take place simultaneously. Alternatively, the parties may want to lock down the transaction for certainty at signing, even though certain actions or conditions may need\nto be satisfied before completion actually occurs. For example, the parties may need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory clearances prior to completion. In this case, signing and completion may be split, with completion happening at a later date. See Section B(1) (Transaction Agreement) above for further details in respect of common conditions, and Section C(3) (Business Protection) below for protections for the business (also known as “gap controls”) in the period between signing and completion.\nCommon Completion Deliverables # Irrespective of whether signing and completion are simultaneous or not, the Transaction Agreement will usually contain a list of completion deliverables, which must be satisfied by the parties (or waived) in order for completion to occur. These may include:\nSeller deliverables: # (in the case of a share sale) executed stock transfer forms transferring the sale shares from the Seller to the Buyer; (in the case of a share sale) existing share certificates in respect of the sale shares in the name of the Seller for cancellation at completion (or an indemnity for any lost share certificates); new share certificates in respect of the sale (or subscription) shares in favour of the Buyer; any resignation letters of directors/auditors/the Target’s secretary; and Target board authorisations (e.g. written resolutions or minutes of a meeting) approving the registration of the share transfer (or subscription) and related steps; Buyer deliverables: # payment of the purchase price; any appointments of new directors/auditors/a secretary of the Target; and a statement of any person who, on completion, will become a registrable person/legal entity in relation to the Target within the meaning of section 790C of the Companies Act 2006 (i.e. persons of significant control); Seller and Buyer deliverables: # copies of the transaction documents executed by the relevant party (e.g. the tax deed, any separate guarantee, employment contracts, any loan termination agreements of the Target, etc.); and board and shareholder authorisations (e.g. written resolutions or minutes of a meeting) of the relevant party approving the entry into and performance of the Transaction Agreement (and related transaction documents). Business Protections # In the case of a split signing/completion, the Seller will usually give certain pre- completion covenants (also known as “gap controls”) to continue to run the company in the normal and ordinary course, and to maintain the business as a going concern. The Seller may agree not to do, without the Buyer’s prior consent, certain actions that might affect the value of the Target’s business or undermine the Transaction, for example:\nchange the Target’s share capital or create, allot or issue shares or grant share options or the right to acquire the Target’s share or loan capital (whether by conversion, subscription or otherwise); engage in material transactions, such as major acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses, or exceed agreed capital expenditure limits; amend the constitutional documents of the Target (e.g. its articles of association); declare or pay any dividends or distributions; make any changes to the Target’s loan or security profile; make changes to the remuneration or benefits of senior management; or commence or settle any material litigation. The Seller may also grant the Buyer certain access rights to the Target’s books and records, and to its premises and management, so that the Buyer can monitor compliance with the pre-completion covenants.\nPost Completion # The parties will need to take certain actions following completion, such as:\nupdating the Target’s books and records to reflect the change in ownership (e.g. amendments to the Target’s register of members, register of transfers, register of directors and register of persons of significant control); making any required filings at Companies House, such as: Form AP01 for any director appointments; Form AP03 for any secretary appointments; Form TM01 for any director terminations; Form TM02 for any secretary terminations; Form PSC02 to give notice of a relevant legal entity with significant control; and Form SH01 for a return of allotment of shares; and payment by the Buyer of any stamp duty on a share transfer (see Section E(4) (Tax) below).\nOther Considerations # Finance # The Buyer may be using debt finance (including intragroup finance) to fund all or part of the purchase price for the shares. Timing will be key, to ensure that all debt documents are in place and funds available prior to completion.\nKey financing documents may include:\nFacility (loan) agreement: This is the main agreement documenting the loan and its terms and conditions (including repayment provisions, interest and events of default). Depending on the value and complexity of the Transaction, there may be several layers of debt (e.g. senior, mezzanine) and several facility agreements. Even after the facility agreement is executed, provision of funds under the loan is likely to be subject to certain conditions precedent, e.g. the borrower providing to the lender documents such as its articles of association, board authorisations (minutes or written resolutions), legal opinions, and a director’s certificate confirming that any borrowing limit of the borrower is not exceeded by the loan. Security document: This documents any security to which the loan may be subject, e.g. a charge over the shares in the Target being acquired by the Buyer, or over other Buyer assets. If the Buyer defaults on its loan repayments, the bank/loan provider can enforce the security and potentially take the shares/assets. Intercreditor and subordination agreements: These contain arrangements between different providers of debt finance (e.g. between senior lenders and mezzanine lenders) in connection with their respective rights and rankings (priority) in the financing, including in respect of any proceeds if the borrower defaults on the loans or becomes insolvent. Antitrust # During the due diligence process, the Buyer should assess the antirust/competition law risks associated with the Transaction, including in light of the Transaction structure, the turnover of the parties and the Target, and the jurisdictions in which the parties and the Target are located or do business. A filing with the relevant antitrust authorities may need to be made, and approval received, prior to completion of the Transaction. In some cases, as a condition to receipt of the antitrust clearance for the Transaction, the Buyer may need to commit to dispose of certain assets following\ncompletion of the Transaction, e.g. where there is significant overlap with the Target’s business.\nGiven the significant implications of an antitrust filing for the Transaction and its timetable, the Buyer should engage specialist antitrust lawyers at an early stage of the process, to determine whether any filing or notification is necessary. In addition, if the Buyer and Seller are competitors operating in the same or a similar industry or market, the parties may have to act with caution prior to completion of the Transaction, in particular when exchanging sensitive information and in respect of any interim access rights or “gap controls” granted to the Buyer, in case of a potential breach of antirust/competition laws.\nA failure to comply with antitrust laws can result in significant fines and in some instances the unwinding of the Transaction.\nEmployment # Depending on the structure of the Transaction, there may be particular requirements with respect to the Target’s employees. For example, unlike a share purchase (where the Target’s employees continue to be employed by the Target irrespective of the Transaction), if the Transaction is structured as an asset/business purchase, there will usually be a number of additional requirements, including under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (as amended), often referred to simply as “TUPE”.\nWhere a transfer of the Target’s business (or asset/part of the Target’s business where the economic entity retains its identity) falls under TUPE, the employment contracts of the employees assigned to that business will automatically transfer to the Buyer on their existing terms (with the exception of old age, invalidity and survivors’ benefits under occupational pension schemes). The Buyer should therefore be aware that it would effectively step into the Target’s shoes as employer of the transferring employees. In these circumstances (subject to a limited number of exceptions), there are enhanced protections for employees from dismissal and from unilateral changes to their employment terms. In addition, prior to the transfer, the Buyer and Target would need to inform and (if appropriate) consult recognised trade unions or elected employee representatives (if there is no recognised union) in relation to any employees affected by the transfer or any measures taken in connection with it.\nTax # The parties will need to consider certain tax matters in connection with the Transaction.\nTax structuring: The parties will need to determine the most tax efficient structure for the Transaction. This will require consideration of any overseas tax issues, whether tax is withheld from dividends or interest remitted from the relevant jurisdiction, and the rules relating to tax evasion and tax avoidance. Selling a member of a group may have additional tax consequences, in particular in relation to de-grouping charges and the availability of group relief, which should be carefully considered. Tax relief: A number of tax reliefs may be available to Sellers. If the consideration for the transfer of shares in the Target is (in whole or part) the issue, by the Buyer, of shares or loan notes to the Seller, the Seller may wish to obtain roll-over relief from capital gains tax which should defer any tax chargeable on the sale until such time as the new shares or loan notes are disposed of. If the Seller wishes to avail of this treatment it will normally require a tax clearance from HMRC. Tax warranties: It is standard for the Seller to give specific warranties in the Transaction Agreement in respect of the tax position of the Target (see Section B(1) (Transaction Agreement) above for further information in respect of warranties and indemnities). Tax deed/covenant: In addition to specific tax warranties, it is common for the Seller to give indemnities in respect of pre-completion tax liabilities. These indemnities, and other provisions specifically relating to tax matters (e.g. arrangements regarding cooperation in preparing pre-completion tax returns and conduct of tax enquiries and assessments), may be agreed by the parties either in a separate tax deed, or in tax covenants contained in the Transaction Agreement itself. Taxes to be paid: These may include: Stamp duty/stamp duty reserve tax: In the UK, a stamp duty charge of 0.5% (rounded up to the nearest £5.00) of the purchase consideration (whether settled in the form of cash, equity or an agreement to discharge a debt) will usually be payable on the transfer of shares, unless an exemption applies (e.g. if the consideration is £1,000 or less). It is usually the Buyer’s responsibility to pay stamp duty, and the Buyer should note that a transfer of shares in a UK company cannot be registered until any stamp duty due has been paid.

As an analyst, my objective was to extract meaningful insights to support business operations without directly altering the database structure. This led me to develop and refine SQL querying techniques that became instrumental in driving data-driven decision-making.\nUnderstanding the Business Context # Our company operated as a supplier, with core activities revolving around:\nProcurement from suppliers Booking sales orders Warehouse operations (Pick \u0026amp; Pack) Stock checks to maintain inventory accuracy Optimising stock availability Managing selling prices \u0026amp; account profitability Customer engagement Light assembly production (ensuring component availability) SKU updates Ensuring quality \u0026amp; compliance Each of these functions relied on timely, accurate data extracted from the ERP system. By leveraging SQL, I was able to generate reports and dashboards that provided real-time insights into stock levels, sales performance, and operational efficiency.\nThe Power of SQL in Business Intelligence # As an analyst interacting with databases, having read-only access is often sufficient. The SELECT statement becomes your most-used command, allowing you to retrieve data without modifying the database. However, when working with SQL, especially in a production environment, it is critical to exercise caution with commands that alter data structures.\nSharing SQL Queries (With Caution) # Over time, I developed numerous SQL queries tailored to our business needs. Some of these queries were proprietary and encrypted by SAP, but I was fortunate to have access. While I will share modified versions to avoid infringement, the functionality remains the same.\nThese queries helped extract insights such as:\nStock movement trends Sales order fulfillment rates Customer purchasing behaviour Profitability analysis at the product and account levels Embracing Self-Service BI with Microsoft Power Platform # Beyond SQL, I also explored self-service business intelligence (BI) using Microsoft Office 365 and Power Platform. By integrating SQL outputs with Power BI, Power Automate, and Excel, businesses can create automated reporting tools that:\nRefresh data dynamically Reduce reliance on IT for ad-hoc reports Enable non-technical users to interact with real-time insights Reference Materials # For those looking to explore SQL and ERP data extraction further, I recommend the followin\nSAP Tables https://sap.erpref.com/\nSAP Learning Hub\n","date":"27 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/sap-sql-reports/01-intro/","section":"Posts","summary":"featuring advanced SAP B1 SQL Reports","title":"Introducing SQL Reports Series","type":"posts"},{"content":"Please note\nProvided for educational purpose.

Introduction # By analysing these concepts, we will go through a process - adjusting/ reorganising the balance sheet to arrive at a Economic Balance Sheet in corporate finance perspectives.\nBalance Sheet # Total Asset = Total Funds Invested Total Funds Invested =\nNon-operating asset Derivatives, Excess real estate, Discontinued operations, Receivables from [[Financial subsidiaries]] (credit card receivables), Excess cash and marketable securities, Nonconsolidated subsidiaries (investments in associates) and Equity Investments [[Overfunded pension assets]] [[Tax loss carry-forwards (NOLs)]] Invested Capital, incl. Goodwill Goodwill and acquired intangibles ROIC with goodwill measures a company’s ability to create value after paying acquisition premiums. ROIC without goodwill measures the competitiveness of the underlying business. Two adjustments needed to evaluate the effect of goodwill properly subtract deferred-tax liabilities related to the amortization of acquired intangibles (due to write-ups) [[Understanding Intangible write-ups in M\u0026amp;A]] Add back cumulative amortization and impairment. goodwill do not wear out, nor are they replaceable. Invested Capital, exc. Good Will Operating Working Capital Operating Current Asset working cash balances, trade accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses. Specifically excluded are excess cash and marketable securities Minus Operating Liabilities Liabilities that are related to the ongoing operations of the firm. suppliers (accounts payable), employees (accrued salaries), customers (as either prepayments deferred membership fees), and government (income taxes payable). a liability is deemed operating rather than financial should be netted from operating assets and incorporated into free cash flow. Interest-bearing liabilities are nonoperating and should not be netted from operating assets, but rather valued separately PP\u0026amp;E \u0026amp; Other Capitalised Investments Book value of property, plant, and equipment net of accumulated depreciation in operating assets. Sources of Capital =\nDebt: Interest-bearing debt from banks and public capital markets Debt equivalents: Off-balance-sheet debt and One-time debts owed to others that are not part of ongoing operations e.g., severance payments as part of a restructuring, reserves for plant decommissioning and for restructuring an unfunded pension liability, unfunded postretirement medical liabilities expected environmental remediation following a plant closure Equity Common stock additional paid-in capital retained earnings Treasury stock (repurchased as an offset account) accumulated other comprehensive income currency adjustments, aggregate unrealized gains and losses from liquid assets whose value has changed but that have not yet been sold, and pension plan fluctuations within a certain band. Equity equivalents : Balance sheet accounts that arise because of noncash adjustments to retained earnings; similar to debt equivalents but not deducted from enterprise value to determine equity value. e.g., income-smoothing provisions most deferred-tax accounts (Separating deferred taxes into operating and nonoperating items can be challenging) deferred-tax assets related to past losses should be classified as a nonoperating asset and valued separately. not equity equivalents. Deferred-tax liabilities related to amortization of acquired intangibles should be netted against acquired intangibles. not equity equivalents. Hybrid securities: Claims that have equity characteristics but are not yet part of owners’ equity (e.g., convertible debt and employee options) Noncontrolling interest by other companies: External shareholders’ minority position in any of the company\u0026rsquo;s consolidated subsidiaries If a noncontrolling interest exists, treat the balance sheet amount as a source of financing. Treat the earnings attributable to any noncontrolling interest as a financing cash flow similar to dividends. Summary of Balance Sheet Adjustments So the key idea here is to separate the operating from non-operating; and then separating sources of capital to the Total Funds Invested. Income Statements # The goal of adjustments here is to\nEnsure that your profit calculation flows solely from operations. Normalised statements In many companies, nonoperating items are embedded within operating expenses. most common nonoperating items are related to nonoperating portion of pension expense. embedded interest expenses from operating leases, one-time restructuring charges hidden in the cost of sale material one-time items in operating expenses After adjustments, estimating operating cash taxes (assuming an all-equity operating level) #ProcessToTaxReconciliation Cash Flow Statement # The goal is to estimate free cashflow to all investors. Total Cash Flow =\nFree Cash Flow (FCFF) = NOPAT - net operating profit after taxes after-tax operating profit available to all investors. Plus Non-Cash Operating Expenses Depreciation \u0026amp; Amortisation Only add back amortization de ducted from revenues to compute NOPAT, such as the amortization of capitalized software or purchased customer contracts. Do not add back the amortization from acquired intangibles and impairments to NOPAT because they were not subtracted from revenue in calculating NOPAT share-based employee compensation Because Since employees have a new claim on cash flows, this claim must be incorporated into the valuation, either as part of cash flow or as a separate calculation Less Investments in Invested Capital (reinvestments) Change in operating working capital. Capital expenditures, net of disposals. Change in capitalized operating leases. Investment in goodwill and acquired intangibles. Change in other long-term operating assets, net of long-term liabilities. For most assets and liabilities, the year-to-year change in a balance sheet account will suitably approximate net investment. This will not always be the case. Currency translations, acquisitions, write-offs, and accounting changes Nonoperating cash flows Nonoperating income and expenses \u0026amp; taxes Cash flow related to excess cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from other nonoperating assets.

It assumes that there are no risk-free profit opportunities in the market. In the realm of asset valuation, several primary approaches and methodologies are employed to determine an asset\u0026rsquo;s fair value.\nAll Corporate Finance Valuation Models that I've come across so far. Valuation Approach Description Best Suited For Key Advantages Key Limitations Prominence Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Fundamental valuation method using projected future cash flows discounted to present value. Including enterprise DCF, and equity DCF. Most general-purpose, applicable to various assets, especially stable companies with predictable cash flows. Theoretically sound, considers time value of money and intrinsic value. Highly sensitive to assumptions (growth rates, discount rate, etc.), complex to model. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Enterprise DCF (FCFF) Values the entire firm by discounting free cash flows before debt service. Firms with stable operations and available financial projections. Ignores capital structure, making comparisons across firms easier. Requires accurate forecasting and WACC assumptions. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Equity DCF (FCFE) Values only the equity portion by discounting cash flows available to shareholders. Firms with stable leverage or companies undergoing significant financial restructuring. Focuses on shareholder value, useful for firms with predictable debt policies. More sensitive to capital structure assumptions, more complex for leveraged firms. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Dividend Discount Model (DDM) Values equity based on expected future dividends discounted to present value. Mature companies with stable and predictable dividend payouts (e.g., utilities, consumer staples). Simple and direct for firms with consistent dividends. Not useful for non-dividend-paying firms or companies with irregular dividends. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Adjusted Present Value (APV) Separates the value of an unlevered firm from financing effects (debt tax shield, financial distress). Firms with changing capital structure, LBOs, highly leveraged companies. Explicitly models financing effects, useful for highly leveraged deals. More complex than DCF, requires detailed assumptions on tax shields and distress costs. ⭐⭐⭐ Relative Valuation (Multiples) Values a company based on market comparables (e.g., P/E, EV/EBITDA). Publicly traded firms, industries with ample comparables (tech, retail, industrials). Quick, widely used by investors and analysts. Relies on accurate and relevant comparables, ignores firm-specific fundamentals. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Sum-Of-The-Parts (SOTP) Valuation Values a company by valuing its individual business segments separately. Conglomerates, diversified businesses with distinct operating segments. Captures hidden value in diversified firms. Requires strong segment-level data, risk of mispricing synergies. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Option Pricing Models Values assets with embedded optionality (e.g., Black-Scholes, binomial models). Startups, natural resources, R\u0026amp;D-heavy firms, distressed companies. Captures flexibility and optionality ignored in traditional models. Complex, requires strong assumptions about volatility and time to exercise. ⭐⭐ Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Analysis Models a private equity firm’s acquisition of a target with significant debt financing. Private equity deals, highly leveraged transactions. Assesses feasibility and return potential of an LBO. Not a true valuation method; depends on deal structure and debt assumptions. ⭐⭐⭐ Liquidation Valuation Values a company based on its breakup value in case of insolvency or distress. Distressed firms, bankruptcy proceedings. Provides a floor value for assets. Ignores going-concern value, often undervalues assets. ⭐⭐ Economic Value Added (EVA) Measures a company’s value creation by subtracting cost of capital from operating profits. Internal performance assessment, capital allocation decisions. Focuses on real economic profitability, aligns management incentives. Rarely used in investment decisions, complex adjustments required. ⭐ 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis # This approach estimates the present value of an asset based on its expected future cash flows, discounted back using a rate that reflects the asset\u0026rsquo;s risk. DCF methods can be tailored to specific valuation needs:\nFree Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF): Calculates the present value of cash flows available to all capital providers, discounted at the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).\nFree Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE): Focuses on cash flows available to equity shareholders after accounting for all expenses, reinvestments, and debt repayments, discounted at the cost of equity.\nDividend Discount Model (DDM): Values a company based on the present value of its expected future dividends, suitable for firms with stable and predictable dividend payouts.\n2. Adjusted Present Value (APV) # Rooted in Modigliani-Miller theorem, APV separates the value of an all-equity firm from the present value of financing benefits, such as tax shields from debt interest. This method is particularly useful for firms with changing capital structures.\n3. Relative Valuation (Multiples) # This approach involves valuing an asset by comparing it to similar assets using valuation multiples derived from market data. Common multiples include:\nPrecedent Transaction Multiples: Analyzes past transactions of comparable assets to determine valuation benchmarks.\nComparable Company Multiples: Uses ratios like Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), and Price-to-Book (P/B) from similar publicly traded companies to estimate value.\n4. Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Valuation # This approach involves valuing each business unit or subsidiary of a conglomerate separately and summing them to obtain the total enterprise value.\n5. Option Pricing Models # Used to value assets with option-like characteristics, this type of models include Black-Scholes with its various forms and binomial options pricing.\nContingent Claim Valuation: It\u0026rsquo;s particularly applicable for valuing financial derivatives or investments with embedded options.\nReal Options Valuation: Extending option pricing theory to capital budgeting decisions, this method evaluates investment opportunities as options, recognizing managerial flexibility in decision-making under uncertainty. Equity under high uncertainty behaves much like a long call option and debt behaves much like a short put option.\n6. Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model # An LBO model assesses the acquisition of a company primarily financed through debt. The objective is to determine the potential returns to equity investors under various financial structures and operating scenarios. Key components of an LBO model include:\nSource of Funds \u0026amp; Use of Funds: Determining the optimal mix of debt and equity financing.\nCash Flow Projections: Estimating future cash flows to service debt and provide returns to equity holders.\nDebt Schedule \u0026amp; Repayment Waterfall: some call it debt sculpture , including further components:\nInterest Expense: Calculated based on the outstanding debt balance and interest rates. Debt Repayment: Scheduled repayments of principal, often based on cash flow availability or mandatory amortization. Covenants: Financial ratios or conditions that the company must maintain (e.g., debt-to-EBITDA ratio) Exit Assumptions: Planning the sale or public offering of the company after a holding period, typically 3-7 years, to realize investment gains.\nSensitive Analysis (e.g. Monte Carlo or Scenario Analysis)\nLBO models are extensively used by private equity firms to evaluate potential investments. However, recent trends indicate challenges in this approach due to rising interest rates and increased default rates among overleveraged companies. For instance, the private equity industry has faced scrutiny for practices that may destabilize acquired companies and broader economic systems.\nIncorporating both LBO and liquidation valuation methodologies provides a comprehensive perspective on a company\u0026rsquo;s valuation, encompassing both strategic acquisition scenarios and downside risk assessments.\n7. Liquidation Valuation Approach # This approach estimates the net proceeds if a company\u0026rsquo;s assets were sold individually, often under distressed conditions. It\u0026rsquo;s particularly relevant in bankruptcy scenarios or when assessing a company\u0026rsquo;s minimum value. The liquidation value is typically lower than the going concern value due to the expedited nature of asset sales and potential discounts applied. Understanding liquidation value is crucial for stakeholders to assess potential recoveries in worst-case scenarios.\n8. Economic Value Added (EVA) # EVA measures a company\u0026rsquo;s financial performance by subtracting the cost of capital from its operating profit. It reflects the true economic profit and is used to assess value creation beyond required returns. However it uses accounting data as model inputs, this fact instantly upsets financially minded me.\n","date":"14 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-03-value-methods/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  The financial term \u0026lsquo;No-arbitrage\u0026rsquo; is also a pricing approach, upon which Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model was developed.

This provides the buyer with a stepped-up basis in the target\u0026rsquo;s assets, potentially offering tax benefits.\ncaldergr.com\nThe United Kingdom does not have a direct equivalent to the U.S. Section 338(h)(10) election. However, the UK tax system offers mechanisms that can achieve similar outcomes:\nElection for Capital Gains Treatment on Share Sales: In the UK, the sale of shares is typically subject to capital gains tax. Companies can sometimes benefit from the Substantial Shareholdings Exemption (SSE), which exempts gains on qualifying share disposals from tax. This exemption applies when certain conditions are met, such as the selling company holding a substantial shareholding in the company being sold for a specified period.\nSection 198 Election: When assets are sold, the buyer and seller can jointly elect to fix the value of certain assets for capital allowance purposes. This election determines the amount the buyer can claim as capital allowances (tax depreciation) on qualifying assets, effectively allowing both parties to agree on the allocation of the purchase price to specific assets.\nIntangible Fixed Assets Regime: For transactions involving intangible assets, the UK\u0026rsquo;s intangible fixed assets regime allows companies to obtain tax relief for the amortization or impairment of intangible assets, aligning the tax treatment more closely with accounting practices.\nWhile these UK mechanisms differ from the U.S. Section 338(h)(10) election, they can be utilized to achieve favorable tax outcomes in corporate transactions. It\u0026rsquo;s essential to consult with a tax professional to navigate these options effectively, as their applicability depends on specific transaction details and compliance with relevant tax laws.\nReference # Mergers and acquisitions Basics Negotiation and Deal Structuring by donald dePamphilis, Academic Press (2011) ","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-03-ma-compare-acquire-type/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Typically, buyer prefers acquiring assets but sellers prefers to sell stock (shares).

Some of the most significant measures are carbon emissions and climate change Social Social criteria address: the relationships a company has andthe reputation it fosters with people and institutions in the communities in which it does business.Important criteria include labour relations, diversity, and inclusion. Governance Governance is the internal system of practices, controls, and procedures a company adopts in order to govern itself,make effective decisions, comply with the law, and meet the needs of external stakeholders Five Ways ESG Creates Value (McKinsey) # ESG may link to cash flow in five important ways: facilitating revenue growth, reducing costs, minimizing regulatory and legal interventions, increasing employee productivity, and optimizing investment and capital expenditures.\nAreas Mechanism Revenue Growth 1. A strong ESG proposition helps companies tap new markets and expand in existing ones. 2. When governing authorities trust corporate actors, they are more likely to award them the access, approvals, and licenses that afford fresh opportunities for growth\n3. ESG can also drive consumer preference. - price premium Cost Reductions Recognizing the opportunities to save and reduce waste Reduced regulatory and legal interventions A lot of industries are heavily rely on government support to survive. (value at risk) Employee Productivity uplift 1. help companies attract and retain quality employees, enhance employee motivation by instilling a sense of purpose, and increase productivity overall. Employee satisfaction is positively corre lated with shareholder returns.\n2. The stronger an employee’s perception of impact on the beneficiaries of their work, the greater the employee’s motivation to act in a “prosocial” way.\n3. positive social impact correlates with higher job satisfaction, and field experiments suggest that when companies “give back,” employees react with enthusiasm. Investment and asset optimization Can enhance investment returns by allocating capital to more promising and more sustainable opportunities (for example, renewables, waste reduction, and scrubbers).

However, the causation direction may be different. It could be that companies with higher profitability simply have more resources to brush up their ESG marketing and practices.\nThis perspective raises the classic statistical pitfall of reverse causation or endogeneity, where it\u0026rsquo;s unclear if ESG practices lead to profitability or if profitability enables stronger ESG initiatives.\nReference:\nA Skeptical Look At ESG The ESG Movement: The Goodness Gravy Train Rolls On ","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-03-value-esg-value/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  There are at least five ways ESG can create value.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eWhat is ESG \n    \u003cdiv id=\"what-is-esg\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#what-is-esg\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKinsey has done an excellent job defining ESG in my view.

Period. This is a series of posts about fundamental concepts of value concept in corproate finance. I will be taking you to go through a series of fundamental basic however important concepts in finance, through small pieces of posts.\nIntroduction # Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at this question below.\nSo often, people use enterprise value, firm value, and market capitalisation (or market cap) interchangeably. However, these terms represent distinct financial concepts, and understanding their differences is crucial for accurate valuation analysis.\nSo the answer is here.\nI suspect if the accounting value equals to market value here, many would choose B.85, which remains to be a wrong answer. Because the operating liabulities should be used to offset operating assets, to assess the true capital requirement for the busienss\nThe Philosophy of Value # In economic terms, value is often defined as utility or pleasure. Yet, human nature leans towards immediate gratification over future benefits, struggling to reconcile present desires with long-term goals. To bridge this gap, we assign meaning to waiting—we call it the intrinsic time value of money. At that moment, finance was born.\nFinance, as a discipline, is philosophically warm and illuminating, though often ambiguous. Many things in life could bear the name \u0026lsquo;value,\u0026rsquo; yet finance scholars sought precision. They defined value as the \u0026ldquo;ability to generate cash.\u0026rdquo; But paradoxically, in their attempt to remove ambiguity, they did not eliminate it entirely.\nBreaking Down Value Measures # Enterprise Value, Firm Value and Equity value are infamous terms in world of corporate finance. There are a few very similar concept to these.\nWhile some consider firm value to be another term for enterprise value, I see a distinction. Firm value encompasses all of a company\u0026rsquo;s assets, including cash and other non-core, non-operating assets. Enterprise value, on the other hand, measures a business\u0026rsquo;s ability to generate cash from its core operations. Market capitalisation, meanwhile, represents the current market value of a company’s equity.\nFormula Scope Formula Market Capitalisation (Equity) Measures the current market value of equity. Shares Outstanding x Share Price Enterprise Value Measures a business\u0026rsquo;s ability to generate cash through core operating activities EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash Firm Value Measures the total resources a company controls, including non-core assets. Enterprise Value + Cash + Non-core Non-Operating Assets Note the EV Extended formula : EV = Equity Market Cap [+] Interest-bearing debt [+] Capital lease obligations [+] Preferred securities [+] Non-controlling interests [+] Other non-operating liabilities [–] Cash \u0026amp; equivalent [–] Non-operating asses\nNon-Operating Liabilities e.g.under funded pension liabilities. By understanding these distinctions, investors and analysts can make more informed decisions, ensuring that they evaluate businesses based on the right financial lens.\nRelationship with Cash Flows # Free Cash Flow to Firm # FCFF = EBIT (1- ETR) + Deferred Tax + Non-cash Items – △NWC – Net CapEx\nWhere:\nEBIT (1- ETR) = Net Income + Interest x (1-ETR) ETR = Effective Tax Rate; EBIT (1-ETR) = EBIT - Corporate Tax Net CapEx = CapEx - D\u0026amp;A △NWC = Incrase in Working Capital Deferred Tax = + DTL - DTA (we can discuss this in another post.) FCFE = FCFF + CF from net debt\nWhere:\nCF from Net Debt = - Debt replay + Debt Issuance - Interest Payment\nNegative Equity Value # Under the following scenarios, a negative equity value is possible:\nScenario Explaination Accumulated Losses If a company consistently incurs losses, its retained earnings will become negative, reducing shareholders\u0026rsquo; equity. Over time, if losses exceed the initial capital invested, equity can turn negative. High Debt Levels If a company takes on excessive debt, its liabilities can grow faster than its assets, leading to negative equity. Share Buybacks If a company repurchases its own shares (treasury stock) at a high price, it reduces shareholders\u0026rsquo; equity. If this reduction is large enough, equity can become negative. Asset Write-Downs If a company writes down the value of its assets (e.g., due to impairment), total assets decrease, which can lead to negative equity. Startups or Early-Stage Companies New companies may have negative equity if they have not yet generated profits and rely heavily on debt or external funding.

This post is driven by a LinkedIn post that I saw the other day, people are debating about return, yield and bond prices. I think it maybe an interesting topic to discuss in my blog. The target audience could be\nanalyst, junior or senior, feeling necessarily to calibrate or refresh this knowledge. general public who are interested in knowing what does their bank mean by APR for their credit card. I hope you enjoy this post.\nMeasuring Return # Holding Period Return (HPR) # Zero coupon bonds, held to maturity # There is a fixed income (bond) product, If we paid X today, and we will receive 100 by end of the period (6 months), when the bond matures, Then we say.\nThe holding period of the bond is P (6 Months) The holding period return is (100 - X) / X The Yield-to-maturity is (100 - X) / X Right, if the holding period is now 18 months, the formula doesn’t change, because in holding period return, as long as the bond doesn’t pay interests during the term, you can ignore the compounding behaviour.\nInterest bearing bonds, held to maturity # There is a bond, The face value of the bond is 100, the maturity of the bond is 12 months. there will be interest payment every 6 months. the coupon rate is 4%. the bond is trading at 101. what is the holding period return if we hold the bond to its maturity.\nIn this case, you need to add the income (interest payment) into your calculation. the formula is\nHolding Period Return = ( Price change + Income ) / Initial Price\nThe price change in this case is 101 - 100 = 1. The income is twice 4%/2 X 100. that is still 4. (because every time it pays 2, and in a year, it pays 4 in total) The holding period return is 5/101 = 4.95% With the formula above, if not held to maturity, whatever price the bond is sold off will determine the ending price and how many times interests payment you will collect will determine the income. and then you can calculate the Holding Period Return competently.\nSo how does the market interest rate come into our play? Well, the price you are paying today for the bond is 1 above the face value 100 for 12 months, that means the market interest rate must be slightly lower than 4%. because of that, in order to get 4% return, intuitively, you will have to pay slightly higher than 100 to make that even. The same intuition can be applied if you are selling this bond before its maturity.\nHowever, by its maturity, the bond price will converge to its face value. Because selling this bond to any other party at maturity, it will always be just at its face value, because whoever hold the bond will receive original issuers payment of its face value (if there is no default of course).\nYou might hear people use the term duration. for zero coupon bond the duration = its maturity. for interest bearing, if people use it interchangeably, correct them. The duration will be shorter than its maturity.\nEffective Annual Rate (EAR or CAGR) # Effective Annual Rate is the most frequent used return concept in investment world. When people mention CAGR, it also refers to this concept. .The concept is defined as percentage increase in funds per year.\nConcept about compounding # When the product is within one year (we call this money market), the convention is to not calculate the compounding effects, therefore not to use the Effective Annual Return, instead we use a new concept Annual Percentage return, which will come shortly. For now, just assume the compounding effect also exit for products within one year.\nA 12 month coupon bond calculates coupon every six month, however it doesn’t pay until maturity, that means it will roll the first interest payment in to the sum and use that to calculate my second interest income.\nPrinciple * ( 1 + (5%/2)) ^ 2\nBut if the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compound every six month ( despite in reality no such strange product exists), then your return is\nPrinciple * ( 1 + 5% / 2) ^ ( 10 * 2)\nBut if the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compound every three month, then your return is\nPrinciple * ( 1 + 5% / 4) ^ ( 10 * 4)\nIf the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compounding is calculated continously, then your return is\nPrinciple * e ^ (5% * 10)\nZero coupon bond, held to maturity # There is a zero coupon bond with a 10 years maturity (or duration). the face value is 100, the bond is currently trading at 75. what is the Effective Annual Rate?\nThe formula is EAR = ( end price / initial price ) ^ ( 1/N ) -1 This is how you would calculate CAGR, Compounding Annual Growth Rate to understand this formula, the easiest way is that you read it backwards, assuming you already know the EAR is r, and you also know the current price is 75, you can calculate the future value = 75 * (1 + r) ^ (N). now you reverse the calculation by the math principle. We don’t talk about the case for interest bearing bonds in Effective Annual Rate, because once you have intermediary cash flow, it becomes a different concept IRR. internal rate of return.\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR) # Effective annual rates explicitly account for compound interest. In contrast, rates on short term investments (by convention, with holding periods less than a year), are in practice often annualized using simple interest that ignores compounding. These are called annual percentage rates, or APRs. There is a formula to convert between the two.\n1 + EAR = ( 1 + APR / n) ^ n\nA credit card’s APR (annual percentage rate) is the total cost of its interest rate (e.g. 20%) plus the fees every cardholder pays as standard, such as the annual fee – it’s the cost of borrowing money over a year. All other fees and charges, such as for missed repayments and cash withdrawals are excluded from the APR.\nTo make it simple, let’s assume you don’t pay the card fee. Suppose you must pay 1.5% interest per month on your outstanding credit card balance. The APR would be reported as 1.5% × 12 = 18%, but the effective annual rate is higher, 19.56%, because 1.015^12 − 1 = 0.1956. Until you pay off your outstanding balance, it will increase each month by the multiple 1.015, so after 12 months, the balance will increase by 1.01512. This is why we call the EAR an effective rate. However the banks are only required to market APR.\nClosing thoughts # Return calculation is one of the basic building block of skillsets for people who choose finance as their major or career. It is confusing at first, but after a few repetitions, it will become clearer.\nIf you are serious about the topic, I recommend you follow the first five chapters of the book\nInvestments by Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan Marcus, published by McGraw Hill.\nAmazon Link Investments: Amazon.co.uk: Bodie, Zvi, Kane, Alex, Marcus, Alan: 9780077861674: Books\nGoogle Link EBOOK: Investments - Global edition - Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan Marcus - Google Books\nThis is one of the top finance books available.

Our goal is to offer practical, easy-to-implement strategies that help you drive performance and achieve measurable results.\nKey Idea # Basket analysis using Association Rule, involves understanding purchase patterns over time to see how products relate to each other within a customer’s buying journey. In this approach, each customer is viewed as a \u0026ldquo;basket,\u0026rdquo; meaning we analyze product relationships based on all items they’ve bought, across different orders. The purpose is to find patterns in what customers purchase together, over time, rather than in a single transaction.\nKey metrics, like support, confidence, and lift, are used to understand these product relationships:\nSupport: The percentage of total customers who bought both items. It gives a sense of the prevalence of a combination in the overall population. Confidence: The likelihood that a customer who bought one product also bought another. Lift: The strength of the association between two products. A lift greater than 1 implies a meaningful association that could predict future purchases. For example, if \u0026ldquo;Computers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; frequently appear in a customer’s purchase history, the analysis could reveal that customers who buy \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; have a high likelihood of also purchasing \u0026ldquo;Computers,\u0026rdquo; helping companies understand customer preferences and potentially guiding personalized marketing strategies.\nAdditional interests? # So, because the purpose of this article is to give sales manager a tool that they can just plug in with their own data to generate some reports, i am just going to focus on that. if you are interested in knowing more about this topic, feel free to move to another article of mine.\n[Basket Analysis for Data analyst]({% post_url 2024-11-04-basket-analysis-for-data-analyst %})\nTemplate: Plug in your own data # There are detailed instructions in the file.

Simply plug in your own investment data, and voilà—instant insights into how to make your money work smarter.\nBefore we start, if you are not confident with your statistical, mathematical and financial knowledge.

Step #0: List your assets. # Choose Equity or equity like Asset to run this analysis.\nYou can run this on any assets in theory, such as ETF funds. Fixed income securities (such as corporate bond) should be proceeded with caution, because the price information you are going to collect may not reflect the true return, as part of the return may come from coupon. If the asset doesn’t pay coupon or the asset is a fund that will just re-invest the proceed from the underlying fixe income holdings, that’s fine, as long as the price information reflect the asset return.\nYou can run this analysis with real estate property assets. you can populate the price index of your local market if there is such available. For periods you don’t have data, you can just use the last period, assuming there is no change. This behaviour in theory underestimates the asset volatility. But in practice, it may not be a bad thing to evaluate asset less often. It is a bit hassle to do because you have to make sure the date column are matched.\nFixed Income Portfolio Optimisation\nFixed Income portfolio typically have their own optimisation framework, such as immunisation. That’s a pretty different objective from Mean-Variance Optimisation framework.\nStep #1: Collect adjusted daily price data # In order collect the adjusted price data, you will need to either manually download the data directly from Yahoo Finance or your custom sources. Alternatively, you can use the python scripts below. All you need to do is to replace the line 4\ntickers = [\u0026quot;^GSPC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;^NDX\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;AAPL\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MSFT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;VT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;GLD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TSLA\u0026quot;]\nin the square brackets, replace these tickers with your own and make sure each is wrapped in either double or single quotation. And then throw this code into runtime, python code is here\nimport yfinance as yf import pandas as pd import os tickers = [\u0026#34;^GSPC\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^NDX\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AAPL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MSFT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;VT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;GLD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;TSLA\u0026#34;] download_path = \u0026#39;~/Downloads/\u0026#39; filename = \u0026#39;yfinance-downloads.csv\u0026#39; start_date = \u0026#34;2020-01-01\u0026#34; end_date = \u0026#34;2023-11-14\u0026#34; # Dictionary to store data data = {} # Fetch historical data for each ticker for ticker in tickers: stock_data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date) # Ensure we\u0026#39;re using adjusted close prices stock_data[\u0026#39;Adjusted Price\u0026#39;] = stock_data[\u0026#39;Adj Close\u0026#39;] data[ticker] = stock_data print(f\u0026#34;Downloaded data for {ticker} with adjusted prices\u0026#34;) adj_data = {} for key, value in data.items(): adj_data[key] = value[\u0026#39;Adjusted Price\u0026#39;] df = pd.DataFrame( adj_data ) filepath = os.path.join( download_path,filename ) df.to_csv(filepath) Step #2: Compute daily return # It is worth to mention that when I downloaded the data into the csv file, the data somehow was formatted as text therefore causing problems in subsequent calculation, it may not happen to you.

I’ve wrote my own code to make this query dynamic, able to process your custom data, most likely with different table headings (asset tickers) from mine.\n{% raw %} let Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=\u0026#34;Table2\u0026#34;]}[Content], Splitbydelimiter = Table.SplitColumn(Source, \u0026#34;Date\u0026#34;, Splitter.SplitTextByEachDelimiter({\u0026#34; \u0026#34;}, QuoteStyle.Csv, false), {\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Date.2\u0026#34;}), withDates = Table.RemoveColumns(Splitbydelimiter,{\u0026#34;Date.2\u0026#34;}), withoutDates = Table.RemoveColumns(withDates,{\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;}), columnheader = Table.ColumnNames(withoutDates), transform = List.Transform( columnheader, each {_, type number} ), TypeChange = Table.TransformColumnTypes(withDates,transform), TypeChange2 = Table.TransformColumnTypes(TypeChange, {{\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;,type date}}) in TypeChange2 {% endraw %} Step #3 : Using Solver to get the allocation. # Please find instructions in Part 3.\nPart 2 can be more interesting to read for people with certain level of financial knowledge or people come from a mathematical, computer science or engineering background, it is perfectly okay if you want to skip these. It mainly explains the certain choices of approach in the worksheet, such one specific return calculation is used instead of another.\nPart 2: How to measure portfolio performance # Intuitively, we are looking for a system to describe the risks and return properties of a portfolio. One of such system is Mean Variance Analysis.\nHere’s where the magic happens—optimizing your portfolio using some fancy math.\nMean-Variance Optimization # Applying this framework, we formalise the portfolio performances in the following three measures. We use\nExpected return to describe returns Portfolio Variance (or standard deviation) to describe risks Shape Ratio to measure the risk/return trade-off efficiency. It measures how much return you generate for every unit of risk taken. That’s it. Job’s done! Simple right? Now because you asked, I am going to dive a little deeper, only for those there are interested.\nThe standard mathematical formula is provided alongside the matrix algebra version, which is very elegant and efficient for its brevity.\nSee the math formulas Portfolio StatisticsStandard MathMatrix AlgebraAdditional NotesExpected Return E(Rp)=∑i=1nwiE(Ri)E(R_p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)E(Rp​)=∑i=1n​wi​E(Ri​)﻿where: • Rp is the return on the portfolio,• Ri is the return on asset i and• wiw_iwi​﻿ is the weighting of component assetExample with two assetsE⁡(Rp)=wA(RA)+(1−wA)E⁡(RB)E⁡(Rp)=w_A(R_A)+(1−w_A)E⁡(R_B)E⁡(Rp)=wA​(RA​)+(1−wA​)E⁡(RB​)﻿E(Rp)=wTE(R)E(R_p) = w^T E(R)E(Rp​)=wTE(R)﻿where:www﻿ is the column vector of portfolio weights {w1, w2, w3…wn}E(R) is the column vector of expected returnsReturn calculation typically isIn standard formE(Ri)=Pi−Pi−1Pi−1E(R_i)=\\frac{P_i - P_{i-1}}{P_{i-1}}E(Ri​)=Pi−1​Pi​−Pi−1​​﻿However, log normal form is much more popular.

Asset return is not normally distributed. It typically has a fat left tail and think right tail in real world This form is also widely used in derivative market where interest rate compounding period is assumed to be infinite. and you have $ P_0 \\cdot e^{E(R)T} = P_1 $ Discussion #2: Daily Adjusted Closing Price # We used Daily Adjusted Closing Price to calculate returns. Adjustments are carried out to account for stock split, dividends and new issuance.\nDo you need to adjust for inflation? Not necessary. As long as all your prices are consistent and results will also remain consistent.\nDo we need to adjust for FX if I have a multi-currency portfolio? Not necessary. This topic is worth a few posts to explain. For simplicity, because the returns are in percentage turns, as long as the weighting is applied after converting asset values into a common currency, the results will be valid.\nDiscussion #3: Over what period should I run analysis for (Horizon) # In common sense, the backward-looking historical period should be in line with your forward-looking investment horizon. Statistically, a full business cycle period is likely provide more informative and less biased prediction.\nIn our file, a roughly four-year period is used. In order to better predict future returns, select a period that is stationary, ideally cover a business cycle, despite not being essential.\nThis data is provided by Yahoo Finance (through yfinance python module, source code already provided in the file).\nDiscussion #4: Portfolio Variance # This measure captures the variation of returns. This measure has many flaws.\nFirst, Two portfolios with very different return distributions can have similar variances. Only if the return distribution is Normal, then, you can define a unique distribution with Mean and Variance. It is widely observed that asset returns are not perfectly normal. Second, only downward variations in price are considered risks by investors, positive variations in price are not perceived as risks. VaR (Value at Risk) capture only the downside variations therefore can potentially serve as a better alternative. (VaR falls out of the scope of this post.) Discussion #5: Covariance Matrix # Example of Covariance Matrix\n\\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{1}^2 \u0026amp; \\sigma_{12} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{13} \\ \\sigma_{12} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{2}^2 \u0026amp; \\sigma_{23} \\ \\sigma_{13} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{23} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{3}^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\\nVariance is defined as $V(x)=\\frac{1}{N-1}\\Sigma(x_i-μ)^2$ Covariance between two random variables x and y (or columns of a matrix) is defined as $Cov(x,y)= \\frac{1}{N-1} \\Sigma (x_i−μ_x)(y_i−μ_y) $ and $Cov(x,x)=V(x)$\nThe term covariance matrix may be misleading to you. It is not any sort of a special matrix. It is simply set of variances and covariances between pairs of columns. A position of any element in the covariance matrix corresponds to variance/covariance between a pair of two columns, e.g. a number located in 3rd row and 2nd column in the covariance matrix represents covariance between 3rd and 2nd columns of matrix A. $Cov(x,y)=Cov(y,x)$ , therefore covariance matrix is symmetric.\nFor N asset portfolio, you will have N x N covariance matrix.\nAny covariance matrix is symmetric and positive semi-definite and its main diagonal contains variances.\nCovariance matrix can only be calculated through actual underlying price data. Practically, the most used two ways to generate covariance matrix in Excel are\nuse Data Analysis Toolpak (Add-In) to calculate the covariance. use Excel scripting formula In the template file, I used the Excel scripting formula to calculate the covariance matrix. This allows dynamic evaluation (Analysis Toolpak require manual re-do the analysis when you change data) and it also avoids Add-in compatibility issues.\nThis is the fundamental piece of portfolio theory. the covariance matrix captures the potential of diversification among component assets.\nDiversification is arguably the only free lunch in the financial world.\nDiscussion #6: Weighting # We assume you won’t go full \u0026ldquo;Wolf of Wall Street\u0026rdquo; by short-selling. All weights in your portfolio will stay positive. Plus, you’ll invest fully—because letting money sit idle is like letting a treadmill gather dust.\nIn our template file, we specify that each asset must take at least 5% of the portfolio value. This constraints avoids the situation of short selling. And if one can borrow at risk free rate, the portfolio return/return can be further optimised to investor’s advantage. Under that condition, we can even constructing a market portfolio and customised a risk / return profile to investor’s preference. In the future, I will dedicate a post for this topic.\nDiscussion #7: Sharp Ratio # The Sharpe Ratio is like a quick fitness test for your portfolio: How much return are you getting for every unit of risk? Are you taking risks efficiently?\nThe Efficient Frontier is where your portfolio hits the sweet spot—maximizing returns for a given level of risk.\nSharp ratio provides a universal, straightforward and useful concept to compare investment performance based on mean and variance. We subtract a risk-free rate from the portfolio return to separate the riskless and risky portion of returns. Then we compare the return premium to the added risk.\nWe will discuss efficient frontier in a separate post.\nMarkowitz demonstrated that diversification reduces risk so that investors can earn the same return with lower risk, or a higher return for the same risk. He argued that “diversification is the only free lunch in finance.” Investors were urged to diversify across stocks, countries and asset classes.\nTeamwork Makes the Dream Work Think of this as figuring out which assets in your portfolio get along and which are the drama queens. Assets with low or negative covariance balance each other out, reducing your overall risk. If many of assets share similar temper, may god bless you.\nSection Summary # So based on what we discussed above, the next step should be intuitive, we want to maximise the return and minimise the risks based on the portfolio.\nNext, we can leverage the Excel Solver tool to do the leg work and compute an optimal results.\nWe are standing on Giants shoulder\nEconomist Harry Markowitz introduced MPT in a 1952 essay for which he was later awarded a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (Markowitz model).\nThis Mean Variance Optimisation framework is a big thing in Finance and is often mixed with a more significant term, **Modern portfolio theory. (like all significant and difficult-to-understand things in our life, it has an acronym, MPT).**\nPart 3: Solving the Optimisation Problem # This is very simple,\n1. Switching on Solver feature in Excel if it is not on yet. 2. Once enabled, you can find them here Then, go straight to the point!\n3. Configurations Guide Objective: Set this to be the shape ratio, set max as a goal. Changing variables: Select the portfolio weighting array Constraints: based on traditional insights to have set some guideline limits for each portfolio asset, for example, no asset should have a weight that’s 10x time than the smallest asset in the portfolio. Solving method Comparing Simplex, GRG Non-Linear and Evolution method in Excel Solver.\nClosing Note # This post is meant to be a practical one. A lot of ideas came up while editing this post.

In this approach, each customer is viewed as a \u0026ldquo;basket,\u0026rdquo; meaning we analyze product relationships based on all items they’ve bought, across different orders. The purpose is to find patterns in what customers purchase together, over time, rather than in a single transaction.\nKey metrics, like support, confidence, and lift, are used to understand these product relationships:\nSupport: The percentage of total customers who bought both items. It gives a sense of the prevalence of a combination in the overall population. Confidence: The likelihood that a customer who bought one product also bought another. Lift: The strength of the association between two products. A lift greater than 1 implies a meaningful association that could predict future purchases. For example, if \u0026ldquo;Computers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; frequently appear in a customer’s purchase history, the analysis could reveal that customers who buy \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; have a high likelihood of also purchasing \u0026ldquo;Computers,\u0026rdquo; helping companies understand customer preferences and potentially guiding personalized marketing strategies.\nStep 1: Cartesian product of Product with itself # Create a Cartesian product of Product with itself(And Product) on a calculated table and calculate the common customers of each combination\nDEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Both (Internal)] = VAR CustomersWithAndProducts = CALCULATETABLE ( DISTINCT ( Sales[CustomerKey] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ), REMOVEFILTERS ( Sales[ProductKey] ), USERELATIONSHIP ( Sales[ProductKey], \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] ) ) VAR Result = CALCULATE ( [# Customers], KEEPFILTERS ( CustomersWithAndProducts ) ) RETURN Result ------------------------------------------ EVALUATE RawProductsCustomers = FILTER ( SUMMARIZECOLUMNS ( \u0026#39;Sales\u0026#39;[ProductKey], \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey], \u0026#34;Customers\u0026#34;, [# Customers Both (Internal)] ), NOT ISBLANK ( [Customers] ) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Sales\u0026#39;[ProductKey] ) Step 2: Customer Support. # Customer Support has a difficult name, but the idea is “what’s ratio of number of common customers of each combination and total number of customers.”\nDEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Both] = VAR ExistingAndProductKey = CALCULATETABLE ( DISTINCT ( RawProductsCustomers[And ProductKey] ), TREATAS ( DISTINCT ( \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] ), RawProductsCustomers[And ProductKey] ) ) VAR FilterAndProducts = TREATAS ( EXCEPT ( ExistingAndProductKey, DISTINCT ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39;[ProductKey] ) ), Sales[ProductKey] ) VAR CustomersWithAndProducts = CALCULATETABLE ( SUMMARIZE ( Sales, Sales[CustomerKey] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ), FilterAndProducts ) VAR Result = CALCULATE ( [# Customers], KEEPFILTERS ( CustomersWithAndProducts ) ) RETURN Result ---------------------------------------------------- DEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Total] **=** CALCULATE ( ****[# Customers], ****REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ) **)** ---------------------------------------------------- DEFINE MEASURE [% Customers Support] = DIVIDE ( [# Customers Both], [# Customers Total] ) Wait, why this common customer is so mess here. Let’s dive into the measure. The core logic here is to first, get the number of customers in the first list of Products, which is a standard measure [# Basket]. Then, you want to use a list of customers for And Product as a filter to filter this measure. This is called Table Filter technique in DAX, relatively advanced concept in DAX.\nThen the question becomes How to do you get this list of customers for And Product? You first use TREATAS to connect the sales table and And Product table,, once they are connected, you can summarize this sales table (with data lineage) by customers. This technique is called Data Lineage. is a basic concept, however easy to trip over even for advanced DAX users.\nStep 3: Customer Lift. # Customer Lift is nothing complex but a comparison of two ratios. Don’t get fooled by its sophisticated name. This measure is comparing the first ratio we calculated above to a second ratio, “What is the ratio of customers for And Product to total number of customers.\n$ $\\frac{Common customers /total customers}{Product B customers / total customers}$ $ This is saying how much more likely customers are to purchase a product (Product) when they have already bought another related product (And Product)\nCustomers Lift = DIVIDE ( [% Customers Confidence], DIVIDE ( [# Customers And], [# Customers Total] ) ) Attribution # This pattern is included in the book DAX Patterns, Second Edition. by **Alberto Ferrari and Marco Russo. I highly recommend their content. It’s excellent work. They are dedicated DAX teachers with comprehensive DAX knowledge. Their work is systematic and excellent.**\nComment on the Power BI Implementation # To be fully honest, DAX is not the best language to implement this analysis. First reason is that DAX\u0026rsquo;s advantage in Context Transitions complicated the code from both writer and report readers\u0026rsquo; point of view. Secondly, it is highly likely the data becomes so large that the report runs slow. The Power BI advantages in producing dynamic computation as user consumes the report doesn\u0026rsquo;t really shine in this situation.\nInstead, I find SQL implemtation is really easy to understand.\nSQL Implementation # This is based on schema of SAP Business One with SQL version v10.0 The SalesAnalysis is a replicated view of the SAP stock sales anaysis report.\nCREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[BasketAnalysis] @CardCode NVARCHAR(50) = NULL, @LastNMonth INT = 12 AS BEGIN DECLARE @AssoStartDate DATE = DATEFROMPARTS ( YEAR ( GETDATE()) -2, 1,1) DECLARE @MinRepeatOrd INT = 2 -- Minimal repeated orders that a customer has to place for this item to be considered a regular item of a customer ;

It’s crucial to understand the difference.\nIn the strategy world, the distinction between strategy and planning is well-defined. Strategy is not planning. Strategy is about making hard choices; planning is about organizing actions. ESG’s popularity may partly stem from its planning nature, which promises a single direction—becoming more ethical, responsible, and sustainable. This approach reassures executives in the boardroom. It’s straightforward, and people tend to favor straightforward solutions. Strategy, however, demands a set of coherent, risky choices that allow a business to differentiate itself from competitors, often by deciding not to compete on certain fronts. This is challenging.\nIf companies truly aim for an ESG strategy, rather than mere planning, their focus must be tailored to their current stage of development. This shifts the question for executives from:\n“What parameters are others using to rate companies, and how can we implement actions to score well?”\nto:\n“Which ESG factors matter most to our specific business context? How can we leverage our unique resources and strengths to create meaningful, sustainable impacts for our stakeholders?”\nBy targeting the ESG factors that align with the company’s strengths and position, executives not only build a positive impact that may be harder for competitors to replicate, but they also enhance their strategic position. This approach offers a genuine source of competitive advantage, setting the business apart.\nESG Marketing isn\u0026rsquo;t a Long-term Solution to Corproate Social Responsibility. # While ESG marketing can temporarily bolster a company’s reputation, it lacks the depth and long-term impact of authentic CSR practices and can backfire if the company fails to deliver on its promises.\nEmbracing accountability # ","date":"4 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-10-you-don-t-have-a-esg-strategy/","section":"Posts","summary":"You Don’t Have an ESG Strategy—What You’ve Been Sold Is ESG Planning.","title":"You Don’t Have an ESG Strategy","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resource/cim/","section":"Lexicon/Resource","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"resource"},{"content":"Executive Summary.
