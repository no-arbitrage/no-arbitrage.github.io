Introduction # By analysing these concepts, we will go through a process - adjusting/ reorganising the balance sheet to arrive at a Economic Balance Sheet in corporate finance perspectives.\nBalance Sheet # Total Asset = Total Funds Invested Total Funds Invested =\nNon-operating asset Derivatives, Excess real estate, Discontinued operations, Receivables from [[Financial subsidiaries]] (credit card receivables), Excess cash and marketable securities, Nonconsolidated subsidiaries (investments in associates) and Equity Investments [[Overfunded pension assets]] [[Tax loss carry-forwards (NOLs)]] Invested Capital, incl. Goodwill Goodwill and acquired intangibles ROIC with goodwill measures a company’s ability to create value after paying acquisition premiums. ROIC without goodwill measures the competitiveness of the underlying business. Two adjustments needed to evaluate the effect of goodwill properly subtract deferred-tax liabilities related to the amortization of acquired intangibles (due to write-ups) [[Understanding Intangible write-ups in M\u0026amp;A]] Add back cumulative amortization and impairment. goodwill do not wear out, nor are they replaceable.

Specifically excluded are excess cash and marketable securities Minus Operating Liabilities Liabilities that are related to the ongoing operations of the firm. suppliers (accounts payable), employees (accrued salaries), customers (as either prepayments deferred membership fees), and government (income taxes payable). a liability is deemed operating rather than financial should be netted from operating assets and incorporated into free cash flow. Interest-bearing liabilities are nonoperating and should not be netted from operating assets, but rather valued separately PP\u0026amp;E \u0026amp; Other Capitalised Investments Book value of property, plant, and equipment net of accumulated depreciation in operating assets. Sources of Capital =\nDebt: Interest-bearing debt from banks and public capital markets Debt equivalents: Off-balance-sheet debt and One-time debts owed to others that are not part of ongoing operations e.g., severance payments as part of a restructuring, reserves for plant decommissioning and for restructuring an unfunded pension liability, unfunded postretirement medical liabilities expected environmental remediation following a plant closure Equity Common stock additional paid-in capital retained earnings Treasury stock (repurchased as an offset account) accumulated other comprehensive income currency adjustments, aggregate unrealized gains and losses from liquid assets whose value has changed but that have not yet been sold, and pension plan fluctuations within a certain band. Equity equivalents : Balance sheet accounts that arise because of noncash adjustments to retained earnings; similar to debt equivalents but not deducted from enterprise value to determine equity value. e.g., income-smoothing provisions most deferred-tax accounts (Separating deferred taxes into operating and nonoperating items can be challenging) deferred-tax assets related to past losses should be classified as a nonoperating asset and valued separately. not equity equivalents. Deferred-tax liabilities related to amortization of acquired intangibles should be netted against acquired intangibles. not equity equivalents. Hybrid securities: Claims that have equity characteristics but are not yet part of owners’ equity (e.g., convertible debt and employee options) Noncontrolling interest by other companies: External shareholders’ minority position in any of the company\u0026rsquo;s consolidated subsidiaries If a noncontrolling interest exists, treat the balance sheet amount as a source of financing. Treat the earnings attributable to any noncontrolling interest as a financing cash flow similar to dividends. Summary of Balance Sheet Adjustments So the key idea here is to separate the operating from non-operating; and then separating sources of capital to the Total Funds Invested. Income Statements # The goal of adjustments here is to\nEnsure that your profit calculation flows solely from operations. Normalised statements In many companies, nonoperating items are embedded within operating expenses. most common nonoperating items are related to nonoperating portion of pension expense. embedded interest expenses from operating leases, one-time restructuring charges hidden in the cost of sale material one-time items in operating expenses After adjustments, estimating operating cash taxes (assuming an all-equity operating level) #ProcessToTaxReconciliation Cash Flow Statement # The goal is to estimate free cashflow to all investors. Total Cash Flow =\nFree Cash Flow (FCFF) = NOPAT - net operating profit after taxes after-tax operating profit available to all investors. Plus Non-Cash Operating Expenses Depreciation \u0026amp; Amortisation Only add back amortization de ducted from revenues to compute NOPAT, such as the amortization of capitalized software or purchased customer contracts. Do not add back the amortization from acquired intangibles and impairments to NOPAT because they were not subtracted from revenue in calculating NOPAT share-based employee compensation Because Since employees have a new claim on cash flows, this claim must be incorporated into the valuation, either as part of cash flow or as a separate calculation Less Investments in Invested Capital (reinvestments) Change in operating working capital. Capital expenditures, net of disposals. Change in capitalized operating leases. Investment in goodwill and acquired intangibles. Change in other long-term operating assets, net of long-term liabilities. For most assets and liabilities, the year-to-year change in a balance sheet account will suitably approximate net investment. This will not always be the case. Currency translations, acquisitions, write-offs, and accounting changes Nonoperating cash flows Nonoperating income and expenses \u0026amp; taxes Cash flow related to excess cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from other nonoperating assets.

It assumes that there are no risk-free profit opportunities in the market. In the realm of asset valuation, several primary approaches and methodologies are employed to determine an asset\u0026rsquo;s fair value.\nAll Corporate Finance Valuation Models that I've come across so far. Valuation Approach Description Best Suited For Key Advantages Key Limitations Prominence Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Fundamental valuation method using projected future cash flows discounted to present value. Including enterprise DCF, and equity DCF. Most general-purpose, applicable to various assets, especially stable companies with predictable cash flows. Theoretically sound, considers time value of money and intrinsic value. Highly sensitive to assumptions (growth rates, discount rate, etc.), complex to model. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Enterprise DCF (FCFF) Values the entire firm by discounting free cash flows before debt service. Firms with stable operations and available financial projections. Ignores capital structure, making comparisons across firms easier. Requires accurate forecasting and WACC assumptions. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Equity DCF (FCFE) Values only the equity portion by discounting cash flows available to shareholders. Firms with stable leverage or companies undergoing significant financial restructuring. Focuses on shareholder value, useful for firms with predictable debt policies. More sensitive to capital structure assumptions, more complex for leveraged firms. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Dividend Discount Model (DDM) Values equity based on expected future dividends discounted to present value. Mature companies with stable and predictable dividend payouts (e.g., utilities, consumer staples). Simple and direct for firms with consistent dividends. Not useful for non-dividend-paying firms or companies with irregular dividends. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Adjusted Present Value (APV) Separates the value of an unlevered firm from financing effects (debt tax shield, financial distress). Firms with changing capital structure, LBOs, highly leveraged companies. Explicitly models financing effects, useful for highly leveraged deals. More complex than DCF, requires detailed assumptions on tax shields and distress costs. ⭐⭐⭐ Relative Valuation (Multiples) Values a company based on market comparables (e.g., P/E, EV/EBITDA). Publicly traded firms, industries with ample comparables (tech, retail, industrials). Quick, widely used by investors and analysts. Relies on accurate and relevant comparables, ignores firm-specific fundamentals. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Sum-Of-The-Parts (SOTP) Valuation Values a company by valuing its individual business segments separately. Conglomerates, diversified businesses with distinct operating segments. Captures hidden value in diversified firms. Requires strong segment-level data, risk of mispricing synergies. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Option Pricing Models Values assets with embedded optionality (e.g., Black-Scholes, binomial models). Startups, natural resources, R\u0026amp;D-heavy firms, distressed companies. Captures flexibility and optionality ignored in traditional models. Complex, requires strong assumptions about volatility and time to exercise. ⭐⭐ Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Analysis Models a private equity firm’s acquisition of a target with significant debt financing. Private equity deals, highly leveraged transactions. Assesses feasibility and return potential of an LBO. Not a true valuation method; depends on deal structure and debt assumptions. ⭐⭐⭐ Liquidation Valuation Values a company based on its breakup value in case of insolvency or distress. Distressed firms, bankruptcy proceedings. Provides a floor value for assets. Ignores going-concern value, often undervalues assets. ⭐⭐ Economic Value Added (EVA) Measures a company’s value creation by subtracting cost of capital from operating profits. Internal performance assessment, capital allocation decisions. Focuses on real economic profitability, aligns management incentives. Rarely used in investment decisions, complex adjustments required. ⭐ 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis # This approach estimates the present value of an asset based on its expected future cash flows, discounted back using a rate that reflects the asset\u0026rsquo;s risk. DCF methods can be tailored to specific valuation needs:\nFree Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF): Calculates the present value of cash flows available to all capital providers, discounted at the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).\nFree Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE): Focuses on cash flows available to equity shareholders after accounting for all expenses, reinvestments, and debt repayments, discounted at the cost of equity.\nDividend Discount Model (DDM): Values a company based on the present value of its expected future dividends, suitable for firms with stable and predictable dividend payouts.\n2. Adjusted Present Value (APV) # Rooted in Modigliani-Miller theorem, APV separates the value of an all-equity firm from the present value of financing benefits, such as tax shields from debt interest. This method is particularly useful for firms with changing capital structures.\n3. Relative Valuation (Multiples) # This approach involves valuing an asset by comparing it to similar assets using valuation multiples derived from market data. Common multiples include:\nPrecedent Transaction Multiples: Analyzes past transactions of comparable assets to determine valuation benchmarks.\nComparable Company Multiples: Uses ratios like Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), and Price-to-Book (P/B) from similar publicly traded companies to estimate value.\n4. Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Valuation # This approach involves valuing each business unit or subsidiary of a conglomerate separately and summing them to obtain the total enterprise value.\n5. Option Pricing Models # Used to value assets with option-like characteristics, this type of models include Black-Scholes with its various forms and binomial options pricing.\nContingent Claim Valuation: It\u0026rsquo;s particularly applicable for valuing financial derivatives or investments with embedded options.\nReal Options Valuation: Extending option pricing theory to capital budgeting decisions, this method evaluates investment opportunities as options, recognizing managerial flexibility in decision-making under uncertainty. Equity under high uncertainty behaves much like a long call option and debt behaves much like a short put option.\n6. Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model # An LBO model assesses the acquisition of a company primarily financed through debt. The objective is to determine the potential returns to equity investors under various financial structures and operating scenarios. Key components of an LBO model include:\nSource of Funds \u0026amp; Use of Funds: Determining the optimal mix of debt and equity financing.\nCash Flow Projections: Estimating future cash flows to service debt and provide returns to equity holders.\nDebt Schedule \u0026amp; Repayment Waterfall: some call it debt sculpture , including further components:\nInterest Expense: Calculated based on the outstanding debt balance and interest rates. Debt Repayment: Scheduled repayments of principal, often based on cash flow availability or mandatory amortization. Covenants: Financial ratios or conditions that the company must maintain (e.g., debt-to-EBITDA ratio) Exit Assumptions: Planning the sale or public offering of the company after a holding period, typically 3-7 years, to realize investment gains.\nSensitive Analysis (e.g. Monte Carlo or Scenario Analysis)\nLBO models are extensively used by private equity firms to evaluate potential investments. However, recent trends indicate challenges in this approach due to rising interest rates and increased default rates among overleveraged companies. For instance, the private equity industry has faced scrutiny for practices that may destabilize acquired companies and broader economic systems.\nIncorporating both LBO and liquidation valuation methodologies provides a comprehensive perspective on a company\u0026rsquo;s valuation, encompassing both strategic acquisition scenarios and downside risk assessments.\n7. Liquidation Valuation Approach # This approach estimates the net proceeds if a company\u0026rsquo;s assets were sold individually, often under distressed conditions. It\u0026rsquo;s particularly relevant in bankruptcy scenarios or when assessing a company\u0026rsquo;s minimum value. The liquidation value is typically lower than the going concern value due to the expedited nature of asset sales and potential discounts applied. Understanding liquidation value is crucial for stakeholders to assess potential recoveries in worst-case scenarios.\n8. Economic Value Added (EVA) # EVA measures a company\u0026rsquo;s financial performance by subtracting the cost of capital from its operating profit. It reflects the true economic profit and is used to assess value creation beyond required returns. However it uses accounting data as model inputs, this fact instantly upsets financially minded me.\n","date":"14 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-03-value-methods/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  The financial term \u0026lsquo;No-arbitrage\u0026rsquo; is also a pricing approach, upon which Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model was developed.

This provides the buyer with a stepped-up basis in the target\u0026rsquo;s assets, potentially offering tax benefits.\ncaldergr.com\nThe United Kingdom does not have a direct equivalent to the U.S. Section 338(h)(10) election. However, the UK tax system offers mechanisms that can achieve similar outcomes:\nElection for Capital Gains Treatment on Share Sales: In the UK, the sale of shares is typically subject to capital gains tax. Companies can sometimes benefit from the Substantial Shareholdings Exemption (SSE), which exempts gains on qualifying share disposals from tax. This exemption applies when certain conditions are met, such as the selling company holding a substantial shareholding in the company being sold for a specified period.\nSection 198 Election: When assets are sold, the buyer and seller can jointly elect to fix the value of certain assets for capital allowance purposes. This election determines the amount the buyer can claim as capital allowances (tax depreciation) on qualifying assets, effectively allowing both parties to agree on the allocation of the purchase price to specific assets.\nIntangible Fixed Assets Regime: For transactions involving intangible assets, the UK\u0026rsquo;s intangible fixed assets regime allows companies to obtain tax relief for the amortization or impairment of intangible assets, aligning the tax treatment more closely with accounting practices.\nWhile these UK mechanisms differ from the U.S. Section 338(h)(10) election, they can be utilized to achieve favorable tax outcomes in corporate transactions. It\u0026rsquo;s essential to consult with a tax professional to navigate these options effectively, as their applicability depends on specific transaction details and compliance with relevant tax laws.\nReference # Mergers and acquisitions Basics Negotiation and Deal Structuring by donald dePamphilis, Academic Press (2011) ","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-03-ma-compare-acquire-type/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Typically, buyer prefers acquiring assets but sellers prefers to sell stock (shares).

What is ESG # McKinsey has done an excellent job defining ESG in my view. According to their report referenced at the end,\nArea Criteria / Conent Environmental Environmental criteria include the energy a company takes in andthe waste it dischargesthe resources it needs, andthe consequences for living beings as a result. Some of the most significant measures are carbon emissions and climate change Social Social criteria address: the relationships a company has andthe reputation it fosters with people and institutions in the communities in which it does business.Important criteria include labour relations, diversity, and inclusion. Governance Governance is the internal system of practices, controls, and procedures a company adopts in order to govern itself,make effective decisions, comply with the law, and meet the needs of external stakeholders Five Ways ESG Creates Value (McKinsey) # ESG may link to cash flow in five important ways: facilitating revenue growth, reducing costs, minimizing regulatory and legal interventions, increasing employee productivity, and optimizing investment and capital expenditures.\nAreas Mechanism Revenue Growth 1. A strong ESG proposition helps companies tap new markets and expand in existing ones. 2. When governing authorities trust corporate actors, they are more likely to award them the access, approvals, and licenses that afford fresh opportunities for growth\n3. ESG can also drive consumer preference. - price premium Cost Reductions Recognizing the opportunities to save and reduce waste Reduced regulatory and legal interventions A lot of industries are heavily rely on government support to survive. (value at risk) Employee Productivity uplift 1. help companies attract and retain quality employees, enhance employee motivation by instilling a sense of purpose, and increase productivity overall. Employee satisfaction is positively corre lated with shareholder returns.\n2. The stronger an employee’s perception of impact on the beneficiaries of their work, the greater the employee’s motivation to act in a “prosocial” way.\n3. positive social impact correlates with higher job satisfaction, and field experiments suggest that when companies “give back,” employees react with enthusiasm. Investment and asset optimization Can enhance investment returns by allocating capital to more promising and more sustainable opportunities (for example, renewables, waste reduction, and scrubbers). Reference:\nFive Ways ESG Create Values, by Witold Henisz, Tim Koller, and Robin Nuttall, McKinsey (2019) Mind the False Reasoning Trap (Damodaran) # In Damodaran\u0026rsquo;s post and video session about ESG, he often highlights the causation between being \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; (practicing strong ESG principles) and being \u0026ldquo;profitable.\u0026rdquo; It is true that many articles claim companies with good ESG practices are more likely to achieve superior profitability. However, the causation direction may be different. It could be that companies with higher profitability simply have more resources to brush up their ESG marketing and practices.\nThis perspective raises the classic statistical pitfall of reverse causation or endogeneity, where it\u0026rsquo;s unclear if ESG practices lead to profitability or if profitability enables stronger ESG initiatives.\nReference:\nA Skeptical Look At ESG The ESG Movement: The Goodness Gravy Train Rolls On ","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-03-value-esg-value/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  There are at least five ways ESG can create value.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eWhat is ESG \n    \u003cdiv id=\"what-is-esg\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#what-is-esg\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKinsey has done an excellent job defining ESG in my view.

Period. This is a series of posts about fundamental concepts of value concept in corproate finance. I will be taking you to go through a series of fundamental basic however important concepts in finance, through small pieces of posts.\nIntroduction # Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at this question below.\nSo often, people use enterprise value, firm value, and market capitalisation (or market cap) interchangeably. However, these terms represent distinct financial concepts, and understanding their differences is crucial for accurate valuation analysis.\nSo the answer is here.\nI suspect if the accounting value equals to market value here, many would choose B.85, which remains to be a wrong answer. Because the operating liabulities should be used to offset operating assets, to assess the true capital requirement for the busienss\nThe Philosophy of Value # In economic terms, value is often defined as utility or pleasure. Yet, human nature leans towards immediate gratification over future benefits, struggling to reconcile present desires with long-term goals. To bridge this gap, we assign meaning to waiting—we call it the intrinsic time value of money. At that moment, finance was born.\nFinance, as a discipline, is philosophically warm and illuminating, though often ambiguous. Many things in life could bear the name \u0026lsquo;value,\u0026rsquo; yet finance scholars sought precision. They defined value as the \u0026ldquo;ability to generate cash.\u0026rdquo; But paradoxically, in their attempt to remove ambiguity, they did not eliminate it entirely.\nBreaking Down Value Measures # Enterprise Value, Firm Value and Equity value are infamous terms in world of corporate finance. There are a few very similar concept to these.\nWhile some consider firm value to be another term for enterprise value, I see a distinction. Firm value encompasses all of a company\u0026rsquo;s assets, including cash and other non-core, non-operating assets. Enterprise value, on the other hand, measures a business\u0026rsquo;s ability to generate cash from its core operations. Market capitalisation, meanwhile, represents the current market value of a company’s equity.\nFormula Scope Formula Market Capitalisation (Equity) Measures the current market value of equity. Shares Outstanding x Share Price Enterprise Value Measures a business\u0026rsquo;s ability to generate cash through core operating activities EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash Firm Value Measures the total resources a company controls, including non-core assets. Enterprise Value + Cash + Non-core Non-Operating Assets Note the EV Extended formula : EV = Equity Market Cap [+] Interest-bearing debt [+] Capital lease obligations [+] Preferred securities [+] Non-controlling interests [+] Other non-operating liabilities [–] Cash \u0026amp; equivalent [–] Non-operating asses\nNon-Operating Liabilities e.g.under funded pension liabilities. By understanding these distinctions, investors and analysts can make more informed decisions, ensuring that they evaluate businesses based on the right financial lens.\nRelationship with Cash Flows # Free Cash Flow to Firm # FCFF = EBIT (1- ETR) + Deferred Tax + Non-cash Items – △NWC – Net CapEx\nWhere:\nEBIT (1- ETR) = Net Income + Interest x (1-ETR) ETR = Effective Tax Rate; EBIT (1-ETR) = EBIT - Corporate Tax Net CapEx = CapEx - D\u0026amp;A △NWC = Incrase in Working Capital Deferred Tax = + DTL - DTA (we can discuss this in another post.) FCFE = FCFF + CF from net debt\nWhere:\nCF from Net Debt = - Debt replay + Debt Issuance - Interest Payment\nNegative Equity Value # Under the following scenarios, a negative equity value is possible:\nScenario Explaination Accumulated Losses If a company consistently incurs losses, its retained earnings will become negative, reducing shareholders\u0026rsquo; equity. Over time, if losses exceed the initial capital invested, equity can turn negative. High Debt Levels If a company takes on excessive debt, its liabilities can grow faster than its assets, leading to negative equity. Share Buybacks If a company repurchases its own shares (treasury stock) at a high price, it reduces shareholders\u0026rsquo; equity. If this reduction is large enough, equity can become negative. Asset Write-Downs If a company writes down the value of its assets (e.g., due to impairment), total assets decrease, which can lead to negative equity. Startups or Early-Stage Companies New companies may have negative equity if they have not yet generated profits and rely heavily on debt or external funding.

I hope you enjoy this post.\nMeasuring Return # Holding Period Return (HPR) # Zero coupon bonds, held to maturity # There is a fixed income (bond) product, If we paid X today, and we will receive 100 by end of the period (6 months), when the bond matures, Then we say.\nThe holding period of the bond is P (6 Months) The holding period return is (100 - X) / X The Yield-to-maturity is (100 - X) / X Right, if the holding period is now 18 months, the formula doesn’t change, because in holding period return, as long as the bond doesn’t pay interests during the term, you can ignore the compounding behaviour.\nInterest bearing bonds, held to maturity # There is a bond, The face value of the bond is 100, the maturity of the bond is 12 months. there will be interest payment every 6 months. the coupon rate is 4%. the bond is trading at 101. what is the holding period return if we hold the bond to its maturity.\nIn this case, you need to add the income (interest payment) into your calculation. the formula is\nHolding Period Return = ( Price change + Income ) / Initial Price\nThe price change in this case is 101 - 100 = 1. The income is twice 4%/2 X 100. that is still 4. (because every time it pays 2, and in a year, it pays 4 in total) The holding period return is 5/101 = 4.95% With the formula above, if not held to maturity, whatever price the bond is sold off will determine the ending price and how many times interests payment you will collect will determine the income. and then you can calculate the Holding Period Return competently.\nSo how does the market interest rate come into our play? Well, the price you are paying today for the bond is 1 above the face value 100 for 12 months, that means the market interest rate must be slightly lower than 4%. because of that, in order to get 4% return, intuitively, you will have to pay slightly higher than 100 to make that even. The same intuition can be applied if you are selling this bond before its maturity.\nHowever, by its maturity, the bond price will converge to its face value. Because selling this bond to any other party at maturity, it will always be just at its face value, because whoever hold the bond will receive original issuers payment of its face value (if there is no default of course).\nYou might hear people use the term duration. for zero coupon bond the duration = its maturity. for interest bearing, if people use it interchangeably, correct them. The duration will be shorter than its maturity.\nEffective Annual Rate (EAR or CAGR) # Effective Annual Rate is the most frequent used return concept in investment world. When people mention CAGR, it also refers to this concept. .The concept is defined as percentage increase in funds per year.\nConcept about compounding # When the product is within one year (we call this money market), the convention is to not calculate the compounding effects, therefore not to use the Effective Annual Return, instead we use a new concept Annual Percentage return, which will come shortly. For now, just assume the compounding effect also exit for products within one year.\nA 12 month coupon bond calculates coupon every six month, however it doesn’t pay until maturity, that means it will roll the first interest payment in to the sum and use that to calculate my second interest income.\nPrinciple * ( 1 + (5%/2)) ^ 2\nBut if the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compound every six month ( despite in reality no such strange product exists), then your return is\nPrinciple * ( 1 + 5% / 2) ^ ( 10 * 2)\nBut if the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compound every three month, then your return is\nPrinciple * ( 1 + 5% / 4) ^ ( 10 * 4)\nIf the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compounding is calculated continously, then your return is\nPrinciple * e ^ (5% * 10)\nZero coupon bond, held to maturity # There is a zero coupon bond with a 10 years maturity (or duration). the face value is 100, the bond is currently trading at 75. what is the Effective Annual Rate?\nThe formula is EAR = ( end price / initial price ) ^ ( 1/N ) -1 This is how you would calculate CAGR, Compounding Annual Growth Rate to understand this formula, the easiest way is that you read it backwards, assuming you already know the EAR is r, and you also know the current price is 75, you can calculate the future value = 75 * (1 + r) ^ (N). now you reverse the calculation by the math principle. We don’t talk about the case for interest bearing bonds in Effective Annual Rate, because once you have intermediary cash flow, it becomes a different concept IRR. internal rate of return.\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR) # Effective annual rates explicitly account for compound interest. In contrast, rates on short term investments (by convention, with holding periods less than a year), are in practice often annualized using simple interest that ignores compounding. These are called annual percentage rates, or APRs. There is a formula to convert between the two.\n1 + EAR = ( 1 + APR / n) ^ n\nA credit card’s APR (annual percentage rate) is the total cost of its interest rate (e.g. 20%) plus the fees every cardholder pays as standard, such as the annual fee – it’s the cost of borrowing money over a year. All other fees and charges, such as for missed repayments and cash withdrawals are excluded from the APR.\nTo make it simple, let’s assume you don’t pay the card fee. Suppose you must pay 1.5% interest per month on your outstanding credit card balance. The APR would be reported as 1.5% × 12 = 18%, but the effective annual rate is higher, 19.56%, because 1.015^12 − 1 = 0.1956. Until you pay off your outstanding balance, it will increase each month by the multiple 1.015, so after 12 months, the balance will increase by 1.01512. This is why we call the EAR an effective rate. However the banks are only required to market APR.\nClosing thoughts # Return calculation is one of the basic building block of skillsets for people who choose finance as their major or career. It is confusing at first, but after a few repetitions, it will become clearer.\nIf you are serious about the topic, I recommend you follow the first five chapters of the book\nInvestments by Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan Marcus, published by McGraw Hill.\nAmazon Link Investments: Amazon.co.uk: Bodie, Zvi, Kane, Alex, Marcus, Alan: 9780077861674: Books\nGoogle Link EBOOK: Investments - Global edition - Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan Marcus - Google Books\nThis is one of the top finance books available. The later chapters of this book dives into many advanced topics in finance such as Modern Portfolio Theory and Equilibrium models in the market, Efficiency Market Hypotheses, these contents are recognised with Nobel Prizes. The book covers equity, fixed income and derivatives, depending on which version you are reading. In my own academic journey pursuing Finance, I’ve spent countless days and nights chewing over some of the chapters in this book again and again. Now looking back, it still such a great book that definitely is worthy of spending time with.\n","date":"25 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-11-about-return-concept/","section":"Posts","summary":"Do you know what does APR on your credit mean?","title":"Fixed Income Returns (Credit Cards)","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/basket-analysis/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Basket Analysis","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/business-intelligence/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Business-Intelligence","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/data/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Data","type":"categories"},{"content":" Goal # This post provides sales managers ability to run simple Basket Analysis insights on their own without having to request support from Data Analyst. Our goal is to offer practical, easy-to-implement strategies that help you drive performance and achieve measurable results.\nKey Idea # Basket analysis using Association Rule, involves understanding purchase patterns over time to see how products relate to each other within a customer’s buying journey. In this approach, each customer is viewed as a \u0026ldquo;basket,\u0026rdquo; meaning we analyze product relationships based on all items they’ve bought, across different orders. The purpose is to find patterns in what customers purchase together, over time, rather than in a single transaction.\nKey metrics, like support, confidence, and lift, are used to understand these product relationships:\nSupport: The percentage of total customers who bought both items. It gives a sense of the prevalence of a combination in the overall population. Confidence: The likelihood that a customer who bought one product also bought another. Lift: The strength of the association between two products. A lift greater than 1 implies a meaningful association that could predict future purchases. For example, if \u0026ldquo;Computers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; frequently appear in a customer’s purchase history, the analysis could reveal that customers who buy \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; have a high likelihood of also purchasing \u0026ldquo;Computers,\u0026rdquo; helping companies understand customer preferences and potentially guiding personalized marketing strategies.\nAdditional interests? # So, because the purpose of this article is to give sales manager a tool that they can just plug in with their own data to generate some reports, i am just going to focus on that. if you are interested in knowing more about this topic, feel free to move to another article of mine.\n[Basket Analysis for Data analyst]({% post_url 2024-11-04-basket-analysis-for-data-analyst %})\nTemplate: Plug in your own data # There are detailed instructions in the file.

By the end, you’ll know how to optimize your portfolio like a pro. Plus, you’ll get a nifty spreadsheet that does the heavy lifting for you. Simply plug in your own investment data, and voilà—instant insights into how to make your money work smarter.\nBefore we start, if you are not confident with your statistical, mathematical and financial knowledge. Don’t fear. A lot of times, the terminologies sound sophisticated and somewhat intelligent, but really the underlying concept is pretty simple. You will have some experience with Excel, and if you can run (not write) some python code, it will make things easier as well.\nImportant Notice Content is for informational purposes only and not meant as a recommendation for investment decisions.\nHere are some results from my sample analysis.\nDownload the File and Follow Along # Here’s your toolkit: a downloadable spreadsheet and some step-by-step instructions.

It’s like having a financial coach on your screen, minus the judgmental glances.\nDownload Excel Workbook To outline the post\nPart 1: How to use the calculator\nPart 2: How to measure portfolio performance\nPart 3: How to optimise it\nPart 1: How to use the calculator # I believe the following screenshot should explain how it works probably better than me. Step #0: List your assets. # Choose Equity or equity like Asset to run this analysis.\nYou can run this on any assets in theory, such as ETF funds. Fixed income securities (such as corporate bond) should be proceeded with caution, because the price information you are going to collect may not reflect the true return, as part of the return may come from coupon. If the asset doesn’t pay coupon or the asset is a fund that will just re-invest the proceed from the underlying fixe income holdings, that’s fine, as long as the price information reflect the asset return.\nYou can run this analysis with real estate property assets. you can populate the price index of your local market if there is such available. For periods you don’t have data, you can just use the last period, assuming there is no change. This behaviour in theory underestimates the asset volatility. But in practice, it may not be a bad thing to evaluate asset less often. It is a bit hassle to do because you have to make sure the date column are matched.\nFixed Income Portfolio Optimisation\nFixed Income portfolio typically have their own optimisation framework, such as immunisation. That’s a pretty different objective from Mean-Variance Optimisation framework.\nStep #1: Collect adjusted daily price data # In order collect the adjusted price data, you will need to either manually download the data directly from Yahoo Finance or your custom sources. Alternatively, you can use the python scripts below. All you need to do is to replace the line 4\ntickers = [\u0026quot;^GSPC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;^NDX\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;AAPL\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MSFT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;VT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;GLD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TSLA\u0026quot;]\nin the square brackets, replace these tickers with your own and make sure each is wrapped in either double or single quotation. And then throw this code into runtime, python code is here\nimport yfinance as yf import pandas as pd import os tickers = [\u0026#34;^GSPC\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^NDX\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AAPL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MSFT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;VT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;GLD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;TSLA\u0026#34;] download_path = \u0026#39;~/Downloads/\u0026#39; filename = \u0026#39;yfinance-downloads.csv\u0026#39; start_date = \u0026#34;2020-01-01\u0026#34; end_date = \u0026#34;2023-11-14\u0026#34; # Dictionary to store data data = {} # Fetch historical data for each ticker for ticker in tickers: stock_data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date) # Ensure we\u0026#39;re using adjusted close prices stock_data[\u0026#39;Adjusted Price\u0026#39;] = stock_data[\u0026#39;Adj Close\u0026#39;] data[ticker] = stock_data print(f\u0026#34;Downloaded data for {ticker} with adjusted prices\u0026#34;) adj_data = {} for key, value in data.items(): adj_data[key] = value[\u0026#39;Adjusted Price\u0026#39;] df = pd.DataFrame( adj_data ) filepath = os.path.join( download_path,filename ) df.to_csv(filepath) Step #2: Compute daily return # It is worth to mention that when I downloaded the data into the csv file, the data somehow was formatted as text therefore causing problems in subsequent calculation, it may not happen to you. But to show you how I work around it. I save the data from the download csv directly to the worksheet ‘yfinance-downloads’, and I used power query to help me reformat the data.\nIf you would like to use my method, you can copy past the csv data to replace the existing data in the ‘yfinance-downloads’ page, and then, go to Data tab and click Refresh All bottom under Queries and connection section.\nPowerQuery code is here ( in case you are interested). I’ve wrote my own code to make this query dynamic, able to process your custom data, most likely with different table headings (asset tickers) from mine.\n{% raw %} let Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=\u0026#34;Table2\u0026#34;]}[Content], Splitbydelimiter = Table.SplitColumn(Source, \u0026#34;Date\u0026#34;, Splitter.SplitTextByEachDelimiter({\u0026#34; \u0026#34;}, QuoteStyle.Csv, false), {\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Date.2\u0026#34;}), withDates = Table.RemoveColumns(Splitbydelimiter,{\u0026#34;Date.2\u0026#34;}), withoutDates = Table.RemoveColumns(withDates,{\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;}), columnheader = Table.ColumnNames(withoutDates), transform = List.Transform( columnheader, each {_, type number} ), TypeChange = Table.TransformColumnTypes(withDates,transform), TypeChange2 = Table.TransformColumnTypes(TypeChange, {{\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;,type date}}) in TypeChange2 {% endraw %} Step #3 : Using Solver to get the allocation. # Please find instructions in Part 3.\nPart 2 can be more interesting to read for people with certain level of financial knowledge or people come from a mathematical, computer science or engineering background, it is perfectly okay if you want to skip these. It mainly explains the certain choices of approach in the worksheet, such one specific return calculation is used instead of another.\nPart 2: How to measure portfolio performance # Intuitively, we are looking for a system to describe the risks and return properties of a portfolio. One of such system is Mean Variance Analysis.\nHere’s where the magic happens—optimizing your portfolio using some fancy math.\nMean-Variance Optimization # Applying this framework, we formalise the portfolio performances in the following three measures. We use\nExpected return to describe returns Portfolio Variance (or standard deviation) to describe risks Shape Ratio to measure the risk/return trade-off efficiency. It measures how much return you generate for every unit of risk taken. That’s it. Job’s done! Simple right? Now because you asked, I am going to dive a little deeper, only for those there are interested.\nThe standard mathematical formula is provided alongside the matrix algebra version, which is very elegant and efficient for its brevity.\nSee the math formulas Portfolio StatisticsStandard MathMatrix AlgebraAdditional NotesExpected Return E(Rp)=∑i=1nwiE(Ri)E(R_p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)E(Rp​)=∑i=1n​wi​E(Ri​)﻿where: • Rp is the return on the portfolio,• Ri is the return on asset i and• wiw_iwi​﻿ is the weighting of component assetExample with two assetsE⁡(Rp)=wA(RA)+(1−wA)E⁡(RB)E⁡(Rp)=w_A(R_A)+(1−w_A)E⁡(R_B)E⁡(Rp)=wA​(RA​)+(1−wA​)E⁡(RB​)﻿E(Rp)=wTE(R)E(R_p) = w^T E(R)E(Rp​)=wTE(R)﻿where:www﻿ is the column vector of portfolio weights {w1, w2, w3…wn}E(R) is the column vector of expected returnsReturn calculation typically isIn standard formE(Ri)=Pi−Pi−1Pi−1E(R_i)=\\frac{P_i - P_{i-1}}{P_{i-1}}E(Ri​)=Pi−1​Pi​−Pi−1​​﻿However, log normal form is much more popular.

Asset return is not normally distributed. It typically has a fat left tail and think right tail in real world This form is also widely used in derivative market where interest rate compounding period is assumed to be infinite. and you have $ P_0 \\cdot e^{E(R)T} = P_1 $ Discussion #2: Daily Adjusted Closing Price # We used Daily Adjusted Closing Price to calculate returns. Adjustments are carried out to account for stock split, dividends and new issuance.\nDo you need to adjust for inflation? Not necessary. As long as all your prices are consistent and results will also remain consistent.\nDo we need to adjust for FX if I have a multi-currency portfolio? Not necessary. This topic is worth a few posts to explain. For simplicity, because the returns are in percentage turns, as long as the weighting is applied after converting asset values into a common currency, the results will be valid.\nDiscussion #3: Over what period should I run analysis for (Horizon) # In common sense, the backward-looking historical period should be in line with your forward-looking investment horizon. Statistically, a full business cycle period is likely provide more informative and less biased prediction.\nIn our file, a roughly four-year period is used. In order to better predict future returns, select a period that is stationary, ideally cover a business cycle, despite not being essential.\nThis data is provided by Yahoo Finance (through yfinance python module, source code already provided in the file).\nDiscussion #4: Portfolio Variance # This measure captures the variation of returns. This measure has many flaws.\nFirst, Two portfolios with very different return distributions can have similar variances. Only if the return distribution is Normal, then, you can define a unique distribution with Mean and Variance. It is widely observed that asset returns are not perfectly normal. Second, only downward variations in price are considered risks by investors, positive variations in price are not perceived as risks. VaR (Value at Risk) capture only the downside variations therefore can potentially serve as a better alternative. (VaR falls out of the scope of this post.) Discussion #5: Covariance Matrix # Example of Covariance Matrix\n\\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{1}^2 \u0026amp; \\sigma_{12} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{13} \\ \\sigma_{12} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{2}^2 \u0026amp; \\sigma_{23} \\ \\sigma_{13} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{23} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{3}^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\\nVariance is defined as $V(x)=\\frac{1}{N-1}\\Sigma(x_i-μ)^2$ Covariance between two random variables x and y (or columns of a matrix) is defined as $Cov(x,y)= \\frac{1}{N-1} \\Sigma (x_i−μ_x)(y_i−μ_y) $ and $Cov(x,x)=V(x)$\nThe term covariance matrix may be misleading to you. It is not any sort of a special matrix. It is simply set of variances and covariances between pairs of columns. A position of any element in the covariance matrix corresponds to variance/covariance between a pair of two columns, e.g. a number located in 3rd row and 2nd column in the covariance matrix represents covariance between 3rd and 2nd columns of matrix A. $Cov(x,y)=Cov(y,x)$ , therefore covariance matrix is symmetric.\nFor N asset portfolio, you will have N x N covariance matrix.\nAny covariance matrix is symmetric and positive semi-definite and its main diagonal contains variances.\nCovariance matrix can only be calculated through actual underlying price data. Practically, the most used two ways to generate covariance matrix in Excel are\nuse Data Analysis Toolpak (Add-In) to calculate the covariance. use Excel scripting formula In the template file, I used the Excel scripting formula to calculate the covariance matrix. This allows dynamic evaluation (Analysis Toolpak require manual re-do the analysis when you change data) and it also avoids Add-in compatibility issues.\nThis is the fundamental piece of portfolio theory. the covariance matrix captures the potential of diversification among component assets.\nDiversification is arguably the only free lunch in the financial world.\nDiscussion #6: Weighting # We assume you won’t go full \u0026ldquo;Wolf of Wall Street\u0026rdquo; by short-selling. All weights in your portfolio will stay positive. Plus, you’ll invest fully—because letting money sit idle is like letting a treadmill gather dust.\nIn our template file, we specify that each asset must take at least 5% of the portfolio value. This constraints avoids the situation of short selling. And if one can borrow at risk free rate, the portfolio return/return can be further optimised to investor’s advantage. Under that condition, we can even constructing a market portfolio and customised a risk / return profile to investor’s preference. In the future, I will dedicate a post for this topic.\nDiscussion #7: Sharp Ratio # The Sharpe Ratio is like a quick fitness test for your portfolio: How much return are you getting for every unit of risk? Are you taking risks efficiently?\nThe Efficient Frontier is where your portfolio hits the sweet spot—maximizing returns for a given level of risk.\nSharp ratio provides a universal, straightforward and useful concept to compare investment performance based on mean and variance. We subtract a risk-free rate from the portfolio return to separate the riskless and risky portion of returns. Then we compare the return premium to the added risk.\nWe will discuss efficient frontier in a separate post.\nMarkowitz demonstrated that diversification reduces risk so that investors can earn the same return with lower risk, or a higher return for the same risk. He argued that “diversification is the only free lunch in finance.” Investors were urged to diversify across stocks, countries and asset classes.\nTeamwork Makes the Dream Work Think of this as figuring out which assets in your portfolio get along and which are the drama queens. Assets with low or negative covariance balance each other out, reducing your overall risk. If many of assets share similar temper, may god bless you.\nSection Summary # So based on what we discussed above, the next step should be intuitive, we want to maximise the return and minimise the risks based on the portfolio.\nNext, we can leverage the Excel Solver tool to do the leg work and compute an optimal results.\nWe are standing on Giants shoulder\nEconomist Harry Markowitz introduced MPT in a 1952 essay for which he was later awarded a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (Markowitz model).\nThis Mean Variance Optimisation framework is a big thing in Finance and is often mixed with a more significant term, **Modern portfolio theory. (like all significant and difficult-to-understand things in our life, it has an acronym, MPT).**\nPart 3: Solving the Optimisation Problem # This is very simple,\n1. Switching on Solver feature in Excel if it is not on yet. 2. Once enabled, you can find them here Then, go straight to the point!\n3. Configurations Guide Objective: Set this to be the shape ratio, set max as a goal. Changing variables: Select the portfolio weighting array Constraints: based on traditional insights to have set some guideline limits for each portfolio asset, for example, no asset should have a weight that’s 10x time than the smallest asset in the portfolio. Solving method Comparing Simplex, GRG Non-Linear and Evolution method in Excel Solver.\nClosing Note # This post is meant to be a practical one. A lot of ideas came up while editing this post.

To get the best results, it\u0026rsquo;s often recommended to:\nUse Simplex for linear problems Try GRG Nonlinear first for smooth nonlinear problems Use Evolutionary as a last resort for complex, discontinuous problems Experiment with different starting points, especially for GRG Nonlinear1 Consider using the MultiStart option with GRG Nonlinear for global optimization2 By understanding the strengths and limitations of each method, you can choose the most appropriate solver for your specific optimization problem in Excel.\nAdditional Learning Resource to check out # Some Solver resources Frontier Solver They have a lot of template files with case studies to help learning\nMicrosoft Offical Documentation\nMicrosoft Offical Tutorial\nOpen Solver Alternative solver solution with advanced models.\n","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-11-comparing-solvers-in-excel/","section":"Posts","summary":"Simplex is more likely to be the best option.","title":"Comparing Default Solvers in Excel","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/excel/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Excel","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/optimisation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Optimisation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Post","type":"categories"},{"content":" Power BI (DAX) Implementation # Goal # This post is share my experience of developing power bi dashboard.

At the end of this post, I will attach links for my Power BI file. Please note this power BI is receiving updates as I write new posts.\nYou can find the Power BI file here, some screeshots are provided in this post\nAttachment: [241103_AdventureWorks_na.pbix][1]\nKey Idea # Basket analysis using Association Rule, involves understanding purchase patterns over time to see how products relate to each other within a customer’s buying journey. In this approach, each customer is viewed as a \u0026ldquo;basket,\u0026rdquo; meaning we analyze product relationships based on all items they’ve bought, across different orders. The purpose is to find patterns in what customers purchase together, over time, rather than in a single transaction.\nKey metrics, like support, confidence, and lift, are used to understand these product relationships:\nSupport: The percentage of total customers who bought both items. It gives a sense of the prevalence of a combination in the overall population. Confidence: The likelihood that a customer who bought one product also bought another. Lift: The strength of the association between two products. A lift greater than 1 implies a meaningful association that could predict future purchases. For example, if \u0026ldquo;Computers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; frequently appear in a customer’s purchase history, the analysis could reveal that customers who buy \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; have a high likelihood of also purchasing \u0026ldquo;Computers,\u0026rdquo; helping companies understand customer preferences and potentially guiding personalized marketing strategies.\nStep 1: Cartesian product of Product with itself # Create a Cartesian product of Product with itself(And Product) on a calculated table and calculate the common customers of each combination\nDEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Both (Internal)] = VAR CustomersWithAndProducts = CALCULATETABLE ( DISTINCT ( Sales[CustomerKey] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ), REMOVEFILTERS ( Sales[ProductKey] ), USERELATIONSHIP ( Sales[ProductKey], \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] ) ) VAR Result = CALCULATE ( [# Customers], KEEPFILTERS ( CustomersWithAndProducts ) ) RETURN Result ------------------------------------------ EVALUATE RawProductsCustomers = FILTER ( SUMMARIZECOLUMNS ( \u0026#39;Sales\u0026#39;[ProductKey], \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey], \u0026#34;Customers\u0026#34;, [# Customers Both (Internal)] ), NOT ISBLANK ( [Customers] ) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Sales\u0026#39;[ProductKey] ) Step 2: Customer Support. # Customer Support has a difficult name, but the idea is “what’s ratio of number of common customers of each combination and total number of customers.”\nDEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Both] = VAR ExistingAndProductKey = CALCULATETABLE ( DISTINCT ( RawProductsCustomers[And ProductKey] ), TREATAS ( DISTINCT ( \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] ), RawProductsCustomers[And ProductKey] ) ) VAR FilterAndProducts = TREATAS ( EXCEPT ( ExistingAndProductKey, DISTINCT ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39;[ProductKey] ) ), Sales[ProductKey] ) VAR CustomersWithAndProducts = CALCULATETABLE ( SUMMARIZE ( Sales, Sales[CustomerKey] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ), FilterAndProducts ) VAR Result = CALCULATE ( [# Customers], KEEPFILTERS ( CustomersWithAndProducts ) ) RETURN Result ---------------------------------------------------- DEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Total] **=** CALCULATE ( ****[# Customers], ****REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ) **)** ---------------------------------------------------- DEFINE MEASURE [% Customers Support] = DIVIDE ( [# Customers Both], [# Customers Total] ) Wait, why this common customer is so mess here. Let’s dive into the measure. The core logic here is to first, get the number of customers in the first list of Products, which is a standard measure [# Basket]. Then, you want to use a list of customers for And Product as a filter to filter this measure. This is called Table Filter technique in DAX, relatively advanced concept in DAX.\nThen the question becomes How to do you get this list of customers for And Product? You first use TREATAS to connect the sales table and And Product table,, once they are connected, you can summarize this sales table (with data lineage) by customers. This technique is called Data Lineage. is a basic concept, however easy to trip over even for advanced DAX users.\nStep 3: Customer Lift. # Customer Lift is nothing complex but a comparison of two ratios. Don’t get fooled by its sophisticated name. This measure is comparing the first ratio we calculated above to a second ratio, “What is the ratio of customers for And Product to total number of customers.\n$ $\\frac{Common customers /total customers}{Product B customers / total customers}$ $ This is saying how much more likely customers are to purchase a product (Product) when they have already bought another related product (And Product)\nCustomers Lift = DIVIDE ( [% Customers Confidence], DIVIDE ( [# Customers And], [# Customers Total] ) ) Attribution # This pattern is included in the book DAX Patterns, Second Edition. by **Alberto Ferrari and Marco Russo. I highly recommend their content. It’s excellent work. They are dedicated DAX teachers with comprehensive DAX knowledge. Their work is systematic and excellent.**\nComment on the Power BI Implementation # To be fully honest, DAX is not the best language to implement this analysis. First reason is that DAX\u0026rsquo;s advantage in Context Transitions complicated the code from both writer and report readers\u0026rsquo; point of view. Secondly, it is highly likely the data becomes so large that the report runs slow. The Power BI advantages in producing dynamic computation as user consumes the report doesn\u0026rsquo;t really shine in this situation.\nInstead, I find SQL implemtation is really easy to understand.\nSQL Implementation # This is based on schema of SAP Business One with SQL version v10.0 The SalesAnalysis is a replicated view of the SAP stock sales anaysis report.\nCREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[BasketAnalysis] @CardCode NVARCHAR(50) = NULL, @LastNMonth INT = 12 AS BEGIN DECLARE @AssoStartDate DATE = DATEFROMPARTS ( YEAR ( GETDATE()) -2, 1,1) DECLARE @MinRepeatOrd INT = 2 -- Minimal repeated orders that a customer has to place for this item to be considered a regular item of a customer ;

It’s crucial to understand the difference.\nIn the strategy world, the distinction between strategy and planning is well-defined. Strategy is not planning. Strategy is about making hard choices; planning is about organizing actions. ESG’s popularity may partly stem from its planning nature, which promises a single direction—becoming more ethical, responsible, and sustainable. This approach reassures executives in the boardroom. It’s straightforward, and people tend to favor straightforward solutions. Strategy, however, demands a set of coherent, risky choices that allow a business to differentiate itself from competitors, often by deciding not to compete on certain fronts. This is challenging.\nIf companies truly aim for an ESG strategy, rather than mere planning, their focus must be tailored to their current stage of development. This shifts the question for executives from:\n“What parameters are others using to rate companies, and how can we implement actions to score well?”\nto:\n“Which ESG factors matter most to our specific business context? How can we leverage our unique resources and strengths to create meaningful, sustainable impacts for our stakeholders?”\nBy targeting the ESG factors that align with the company’s strengths and position, executives not only build a positive impact that may be harder for competitors to replicate, but they also enhance their strategic position. This approach offers a genuine source of competitive advantage, setting the business apart.\nESG Marketing isn\u0026rsquo;t a Long-term Solution to Corproate Social Responsibility. # While ESG marketing can temporarily bolster a company’s reputation, it lacks the depth and long-term impact of authentic CSR practices and can backfire if the company fails to deliver on its promises.\nEmbracing accountability # ","date":"4 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-10-you-don-t-have-a-esg-strategy/","section":"Posts","summary":"You Don’t Have an ESG Strategy—What You’ve Been Sold Is ESG Planning.","title":"You Don’t Have an ESG Strategy","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resource/cim/","section":"Lexicon/Resource","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"resource"},{"content":"Executive Summary.
