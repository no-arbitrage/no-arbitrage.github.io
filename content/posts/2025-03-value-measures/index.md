This is a series of posts about fundamental concepts of value concept in corproate finance. I will be taking you to go through a series of fundamental basic however important concepts in finance, through small pieces of posts.

### Introduction
Let's take a look at this question below.

![Question about EV Calculation](EV-flashcard-front.png)

So often, people use enterprise value, firm value, and market capitalisation (or market cap) interchangeably. However, these terms represent distinct financial concepts, and understanding their differences is crucial for accurate valuation analysis.

So the answer is here.

I suspect if the accounting value equals to  market value here, many would choose B.85, which remains to be a wrong answer. Because the operating liabulities should be used to offset operating assets, to assess the true capital requirement for the busienss

### The Philosophy of Value

In economic terms, value is often defined as utility or pleasure. Yet, human nature leans towards immediate gratification over future benefits, struggling to reconcile present desires with long-term goals. To bridge this gap, we assign meaning to waitingâ€”we call it the intrinsic time value of money. At that moment, finance was born.

Finance, as a discipline, is philosophically warm and illuminating, though often ambiguous. Many things in life could bear the name 'value,' yet finance scholars sought precision. They defined value as the "ability to generate cash." But paradoxically, in their attempt to remove ambiguity, they did not eliminate it entirely.

### Breaking Down Value Measures

Enterprise Value,  Firm Value and Equity value are infamous terms in world of corporate finance. There are a few very similar concept to these.

While some consider firm value to be another term for enterprise value, I see a distinction. Firm value encompasses all of a company's assets, including cash and other non-core, non-operating assets. Enterprise value, on the other hand, measures a business's ability to generate cash from its core operations. Market capitalisation, meanwhile, represents the current market value of a companyâ€™s equity.

| Formula | Scope | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Market Capitalisation (Equity) | Measures the current market value of equity. | Shares Outstanding x Share Price |
| Enterprise Value | Measures a business's ability to generate cash through core operating activities | EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash |
| Firm Value | Measures the total resources a company controls, including non-core assets. | Enterprise Value + Cash + Non-core Non-Operating Assets |

Note the EV Extended formula :

**EV** = <br>
Equity Market Cap 
<br>[+] Interest-bearing debt 
<br>[+] Capital lease obligations
<br>[+] Preferred securities
<br>[+] Non-controlling interests 
<br> [+] Other non-operating liabilities 
<br>[â€“] Cash & equivalent
<br>[â€“] Non-operating asses


Non-Operating Liabilities e.g.under funded pension liabilities.
</br> By understanding these distinctions, investors and analysts can make more informed decisions, ensuring that they evaluate businesses based on the right financial lens.
