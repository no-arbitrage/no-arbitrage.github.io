# Power BI (DAX) Implementation

## Goal

This post is share my experience of implementing basket analysis in Power BI and sql. At the end of this post, I will attach links for my Power BI file. Please note this power BI is receiving updates as I write new posts. 

You can find the Power BI file here, some screeshots are provided in this post

## Key Idea

Basket analysis using Association Rule, involves understanding purchase patterns over time to see how products relate to each other within a customer’s buying journey. In this approach, each customer is viewed as a "basket," meaning we analyze product relationships based on all items they’ve bought, across different orders. The purpose is to find patterns in what customers purchase together, over time, rather than in a single transaction.

Key metrics, like *support*, *confidence*, and *lift*, are used to understand these product relationships:

- **Support**: The percentage of total customers who bought both items. It gives a sense of the prevalence of a combination in the overall population.
- **Confidence**: The likelihood that a customer who bought one product also bought another.
- **Lift**: The strength of the association between two products. A lift greater than 1 implies a meaningful association that could predict future purchases.

For example, if "Computers" and "Cell phones" frequently appear in a customer’s purchase history, the analysis could reveal that customers who buy "Cell phones" have a high likelihood of also purchasing "Computers," helping companies understand customer preferences and potentially guiding personalized marketing strategies.

### Step 1: Cartesian  product of Product with itself 

Create a Cartesian  product of Product with itself(And Product) on a calculated table and calculate the common customers of each combination

```jsx
DEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Both (Internal)] = 

 VAR CustomersWithAndProducts =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        DISTINCT ( Sales[CustomerKey] ),
        REMOVEFILTERS ( 'Product' ),
        REMOVEFILTERS ( Sales[ProductKey] ),
        USERELATIONSHIP ( Sales[ProductKey], 'And Product'[And ProductKey] )
    )
VAR Result =
    CALCULATE ( [# Customers], KEEPFILTERS ( CustomersWithAndProducts ) )
RETURN
    Result
------------------------------------------
EVALUATE
RawProductsCustomers = 
FILTER (
    SUMMARIZECOLUMNS (
        'Sales'[ProductKey],
        'And Product'[And ProductKey],
        "Customers", [# Customers Both (Internal)]
    ),
    NOT ISBLANK ( [Customers] ) && 'And Product'[And ProductKey] <> 'Sales'[ProductKey]
)
```

### Step 2: Customer Support. 

Customer Support has a difficult name, but the idea is “what’s ratio of number of common customers of each combination and total number of customers.”

```jsx
DEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Both] = 
VAR ExistingAndProductKey =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        DISTINCT ( RawProductsCustomers[And ProductKey] ),
        TREATAS (
            DISTINCT ( 'And Product'[And ProductKey] ),
            RawProductsCustomers[And ProductKey]
        )
    )
VAR FilterAndProducts =
    TREATAS (
        EXCEPT (
            ExistingAndProductKey,
            DISTINCT ( 'Product'[ProductKey] )
        ),
        Sales[ProductKey]
    )
VAR CustomersWithAndProducts =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        SUMMARIZE ( Sales, Sales[CustomerKey] ),
        REMOVEFILTERS ( 'Product' ),
        FilterAndProducts
    )
VAR Result =
    CALCULATE (
        [# Customers],
        KEEPFILTERS ( CustomersWithAndProducts )
    )
RETURN
    Result
----------------------------------------------------
DEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Total] **=** 
CALCULATE ( 
    ****[# Customers], 
    ****REMOVEFILTERS ( 'Product' ) 
**)**
    
----------------------------------------------------    
DEFINE MEASURE [% Customers Support] = 
DIVIDE ( [# Customers Both], [# Customers Total] )
    

```

Wait, why this common customer is so mess here. Let’s dive into the measure. The core logic here is to first, get the number of customers in the first list of Products, which is a standard measure [# Basket]. Then, you want to use a list of customers for And Product  as a filter to filter this measure. This is called Table Filter technique in DAX, relatively advanced concept in DAX. 

Then the question becomes How to do you get this list of customers for And Product? You first use TREATAS to connect the sales table and And Product table,, once they are connected, you can summarize this sales table (with data lineage) by customers. This technique is called Data Lineage. is a basic concept, however easy to trip over even for advanced DAX users. 

### Step 3: Customer Lift. 

Customer Lift is nothing complex but a comparison of two ratios. Don’t get fooled by its sophisticated name. This measure is comparing the first ratio we calculated above to a second ratio, “What is the ratio of customers for **And Product** to total number of customers.

``` 
$
$\frac{Common customers /total customers}{Product B customers / total customers}$
$
```

**This is saying how much more likely customers are to purchase a product (Product) when they have already bought another related product (And Product)** 

```jsx
Customers Lift = 
DIVIDE (
    [% Customers Confidence],
    DIVIDE (
        [# Customers And],
        [# Customers Total]
    )
)
```

### **Attribution**

This pattern is included in the book [**DAX Patterns, Second Edition**](https://www.daxpatterns.com/books/dax-patterns-second-edition/). by [**Alberto Ferrari](http://www.sqlbi.com/articles/author/alberto-ferrari/) and [Marco Russo](http://www.sqlbi.com/articles/author/marco-russo/).  I highly recommend their content. It’s excellent work. They are dedicated DAX teachers with comprehensive DAX knowledge. Their work is systematic and excellent.**

# Comment on the Power BI Implementation

To be fully honest, DAX is not the best language to implement this analysis. First reason is that DAX's advantage in Context Transitions complicated the code from both writer and report readers' point of view.  Secondly, it is highly likely the data becomes so large that the report runs slow. The Power BI advantages in producing dynamic computation as user consumes the report doesn't really shine in this situation.

Instead, I find SQL implemtation is really easy to understand. 

# SQL Implementation

This is based on schema of SAP Business One with SQL version v10.0
The SalesAnalysis is a replicated view of the SAP stock sales anaysis report. 

```sql
