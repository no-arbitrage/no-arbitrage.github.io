# Unlocking ERP Insights with SQL: A Practical Guide for Analysts

In my previous role, I found myself navigating vast datasets within our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, **SAP Business One (SQL Server, On-Premise, Version 10.0)**. As an analyst, my objective was to extract meaningful insights to support business operations without directly altering the database structure. This led me to develop and refine SQL querying techniques that became instrumental in driving data-driven decision-making.

## Understanding the Business Context
Our company operated as a supplier, with core activities revolving around:

- Procurement from suppliers  
- Booking sales orders  
- Warehouse operations (**Pick & Pack**)  
- Stock checks to maintain inventory accuracy  
- Optimising stock availability  
- Managing selling prices & account profitability  
- Customer engagement  
- Light assembly production (ensuring component availability)  
- SKU updates  
- Ensuring quality & compliance  

Each of these functions relied on timely, accurate data extracted from the ERP system. By leveraging SQL, I was able to generate reports and dashboards that provided real-time insights into stock levels, sales performance, and operational efficiency.

## The Power of SQL in Business Intelligence
As an analyst interacting with databases, having **read-only access** is often sufficient. The `SELECT` statement becomes your most-used command, allowing you to retrieve data without modifying the database. However, when working with SQL, especially in a production environment, it is critical to exercise caution with commands that alter data structures.

## Sharing SQL Queries (With Caution)
Over time, I developed numerous SQL queries tailored to our business needs. Some of these queries were proprietary and encrypted by SAP, but I was fortunate to have access. While I will share modified versions to avoid infringement, the functionality remains the same.

These queries helped extract insights such as:

- Stock movement trends  
- Sales order fulfillment rates  
- Customer purchasing behaviour  
- Profitability analysis at the product and account levels  

## Embracing Self-Service BI with Microsoft Power Platform
Beyond SQL, I also explored **self-service business intelligence (BI)** using **Microsoft Office 365** and **Power Platform**. By integrating SQL outputs with **Power BI, Power Automate, and Excel**, businesses can create automated reporting tools that:

- Refresh data dynamically  
- Reduce reliance on IT for ad-hoc reports  
- Enable non-technical users to interact with real-time insights
