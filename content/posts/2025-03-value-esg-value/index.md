There are at least five ways ESG can create value. 
{{< /lead >}}
## What is ESG

McKinsey has done an excellent job defining ESG in my view. According to their report referenced at the end,

| Area | Criteria / Conent |
| ------| --------|
| **Environmental** | Environmental criteria include <ul><li>the energy a company takes in and</li><li>the waste it discharges</li><li>the resources it needs, and</li><li>the consequences for living beings as a result.</ul> Some of the most significant measures are carbon emissions and climate change |
| **Social** | Social criteria address: <ul><li>the relationships a company has and</li><li>the reputation it fosters with people and institutions in the communities in which it does business.</li><li>Important criteria include labour relations, diversity, and inclusion.</ul> |
| **Governance** | Governance is the internal system of practices, controls, and procedures a company adopts in order to govern itself,make effective decisions, comply with the law, and meet the needs of external stakeholders |

## Five Ways ESG Creates Value (McKinsey)

ESG may link to cash flow in five important ways: facilitating revenue growth, reducing costs, minimizing regulatory and legal interventions, increasing employee productivity, and optimizing investment and capital expenditures.

When governing authorities trust corporate actors, they are more likely to award them the access, approvals, and licenses that afford fresh opportunities for growth<br>3.

The stronger an employee’s perception of impact on the beneficiaries of their work, the greater the employee’s motivation to act in a “prosocial” way.<br>3. positive social impact correlates with higher job satisfaction, and field experiments suggest that when companies “give back,” employees react with enthusiasm. |

## Mind the False Reasoning Trap (Damodaran)

In Damodaran's post and video session about ESG, he often highlights the causation between being "good" (practicing strong ESG principles) and being "profitable." It is true that many articles claim companies with good ESG practices are more likely to achieve superior profitability. However, the causation direction may be different. It could be that companies with higher profitability simply have more resources to brush up their ESG marketing and practices.

This perspective raises the classic statistical pitfall of **reverse causation** or **endogeneity**, where it's unclear if ESG practices lead to profitability or if profitability enables stronger ESG initiatives.
