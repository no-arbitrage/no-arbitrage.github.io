This post is driven by a LinkedIn post that I saw the other day, people are debating about return, yield and bond prices. I think it maybe an interesting topic to discuss in my blog. The target audience could be\nanalyst, junior or senior, feeling necessarily to calibrate or refresh this knowledge. general public who are interested in knowing what does their bank mean by APR for their credit card. I hope you enjoy this post.\nMeasuring Return # Holding Period Return (HPR) # Zero coupon bonds, held to maturity # There is a fixed income (bond) product, If we paid X today, and we will receive 100 by end of the period (6 months), when the bond matures, Then we say.\nThe holding period of the bond is P (6 Months) The holding period return is (100 - X) / X The Yield-to-maturity is (100 - X) / X Right, if the holding period is now 18 months, the formula doesn’t change, because in holding period return, as long as the bond doesn’t pay interests during the term, you can ignore the compounding behaviour.\nInterest bearing bonds, held to maturity # There is a bond, The face value of the bond is 100, the maturity of the bond is 12 months. there will be interest payment every 6 months. the coupon rate is 4%. the bond is trading at 101. what is the holding period return if we hold the bond to its maturity.\nIn this case, you need to add the income (interest payment) into your calculation. the formula is\nHolding Period Return = ( Price change + Income ) / Initial Price\nThe price change in this case is 101 - 100 = 1. The income is twice 4%/2 X 100. that is still 4. (because every time it pays 2, and in a year, it pays 4 in total) The holding period return is 5/101 = 4.95% With the formula above, if not held to maturity, whatever price the bond is sold off will determine the ending price and how many times interests payment you will collect will determine the income. and then you can calculate the Holding Period Return competently.\nSo how does the market interest rate come into our play? Well, the price you are paying today for the bond is 1 above the face value 100 for 12 months, that means the market interest rate must be slightly lower than 4%. because of that, in order to get 4% return, intuitively, you will have to pay slightly higher than 100 to make that even. The same intuition can be applied if you are selling this bond before its maturity.\nHowever, by its maturity, the bond price will converge to its face value. Because selling this bond to any other party at maturity, it will always be just at its face value, because whoever hold the bond will receive original issuers payment of its face value (if there is no default of course).\nYou might hear people use the term duration. for zero coupon bond the duration = its maturity. for interest bearing, if people use it interchangeably, correct them. The duration will be shorter than its maturity.\nEffective Annual Rate (EAR or CAGR) # Effective Annual Rate is the most frequent used return concept in investment world. When people mention CAGR, it also refers to this concept. .The concept is defined as percentage increase in funds per year.\nConcept about compounding # When the product is within one year (we call this money market), the convention is to not calculate the compounding effects, therefore not to use the Effective Annual Return, instead we use a new concept Annual Percentage return, which will come shortly. For now, just assume the compounding effect also exit for products within one year.\nA 12 month coupon bond calculates coupon every six month, however it doesn’t pay until maturity, that means it will roll the first interest payment in to the sum and use that to calculate my second interest income.\nPrinciple * ( 1 + (5%/2)) ^ 2\nBut if the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compound every six month ( despite in reality no such strange product exists), then your return is\nPrinciple * ( 1 + 5% / 2) ^ ( 10 * 2)\nBut if the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compound every three month, then your return is\nPrinciple * ( 1 + 5% / 4) ^ ( 10 * 4)\nIf the product is 10 years long, no coupon payment before maturity, it explicitly says interest compounding is calculated continously, then your return is\nPrinciple * e ^ (5% * 10)\nZero coupon bond, held to maturity # There is a zero coupon bond with a 10 years maturity (or duration). the face value is 100, the bond is currently trading at 75. what is the Effective Annual Rate?\nThe formula is EAR = ( end price / initial price ) ^ ( 1/N ) -1 This is how you would calculate CAGR, Compounding Annual Growth Rate to understand this formula, the easiest way is that you read it backwards, assuming you already know the EAR is r, and you also know the current price is 75, you can calculate the future value = 75 * (1 + r) ^ (N). now you reverse the calculation by the math principle. We don’t talk about the case for interest bearing bonds in Effective Annual Rate, because once you have intermediary cash flow, it becomes a different concept IRR. internal rate of return.\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR) # Effective annual rates explicitly account for compound interest. In contrast, rates on short term investments (by convention, with holding periods less than a year), are in practice often annualized using simple interest that ignores compounding. These are called annual percentage rates, or APRs. There is a formula to convert between the two.\n1 + EAR = ( 1 + APR / n) ^ n\nA credit card’s APR (annual percentage rate) is the total cost of its interest rate (e.g. 20%) plus the fees every cardholder pays as standard, such as the annual fee – it’s the cost of borrowing money over a year. All other fees and charges, such as for missed repayments and cash withdrawals are excluded from the APR.\nTo make it simple, let’s assume you don’t pay the card fee. Suppose you must pay 1.5% interest per month on your outstanding credit card balance. The APR would be reported as 1.5% × 12 = 18%, but the effective annual rate is higher, 19.56%, because 1.015^12 − 1 = 0.1956. Until you pay off your outstanding balance, it will increase each month by the multiple 1.015, so after 12 months, the balance will increase by 1.01512. This is why we call the EAR an effective rate. However the banks are only required to market APR.\nClosing thoughts # Return calculation is one of the basic building block of skillsets for people who choose finance as their major or career. It is confusing at first, but after a few repetitions, it will become clearer.\nIf you are serious about the topic, I recommend you follow the first five chapters of the book\nInvestments by Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan Marcus, published by McGraw Hill.\nAmazon Link Investments: Amazon.co.uk: Bodie, Zvi, Kane, Alex, Marcus, Alan: 9780077861674: Books\nGoogle Link EBOOK: Investments - Global edition - Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan Marcus - Google Books\nThis is one of the top finance books available.

Our goal is to offer practical, easy-to-implement strategies that help you drive performance and achieve measurable results.\nKey Idea # Basket analysis using Association Rule, involves understanding purchase patterns over time to see how products relate to each other within a customer’s buying journey. In this approach, each customer is viewed as a \u0026ldquo;basket,\u0026rdquo; meaning we analyze product relationships based on all items they’ve bought, across different orders. The purpose is to find patterns in what customers purchase together, over time, rather than in a single transaction.\nKey metrics, like support, confidence, and lift, are used to understand these product relationships:\nSupport: The percentage of total customers who bought both items. It gives a sense of the prevalence of a combination in the overall population. Confidence: The likelihood that a customer who bought one product also bought another. Lift: The strength of the association between two products. A lift greater than 1 implies a meaningful association that could predict future purchases. For example, if \u0026ldquo;Computers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; frequently appear in a customer’s purchase history, the analysis could reveal that customers who buy \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; have a high likelihood of also purchasing \u0026ldquo;Computers,\u0026rdquo; helping companies understand customer preferences and potentially guiding personalized marketing strategies.\nAdditional interests? # So, because the purpose of this article is to give sales manager a tool that they can just plug in with their own data to generate some reports, i am just going to focus on that. if you are interested in knowing more about this topic, feel free to move to another article of mine.\n[Basket Analysis for Data analyst]({% post_url 2024-11-04-basket-analysis-for-data-analyst %})\nTemplate: Plug in your own data # There are detailed instructions in the file.

Step #0: List your assets. # Choose Equity or equity like Asset to run this analysis.\nYou can run this on any assets in theory, such as ETF funds. Fixed income securities (such as corporate bond) should be proceeded with caution, because the price information you are going to collect may not reflect the true return, as part of the return may come from coupon. If the asset doesn’t pay coupon or the asset is a fund that will just re-invest the proceed from the underlying fixe income holdings, that’s fine, as long as the price information reflect the asset return.\nYou can run this analysis with real estate property assets. you can populate the price index of your local market if there is such available. For periods you don’t have data, you can just use the last period, assuming there is no change. This behaviour in theory underestimates the asset volatility. But in practice, it may not be a bad thing to evaluate asset less often. It is a bit hassle to do because you have to make sure the date column are matched.\nFixed Income Portfolio Optimisation\nFixed Income portfolio typically have their own optimisation framework, such as immunisation. That’s a pretty different objective from Mean-Variance Optimisation framework.\nStep #1: Collect adjusted daily price data # In order collect the adjusted price data, you will need to either manually download the data directly from Yahoo Finance or your custom sources. Alternatively, you can use the python scripts below. All you need to do is to replace the line 4\ntickers = [\u0026quot;^GSPC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;^NDX\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;AAPL\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MSFT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;VT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;GLD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TSLA\u0026quot;]\nin the square brackets, replace these tickers with your own and make sure each is wrapped in either double or single quotation. And then throw this code into runtime, python code is here\nimport yfinance as yf import pandas as pd import os tickers = [\u0026#34;^GSPC\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^NDX\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AAPL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MSFT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;VT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;GLD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;TSLA\u0026#34;] download_path = \u0026#39;~/Downloads/\u0026#39; filename = \u0026#39;yfinance-downloads.csv\u0026#39; start_date = \u0026#34;2020-01-01\u0026#34; end_date = \u0026#34;2023-11-14\u0026#34; # Dictionary to store data data = {} # Fetch historical data for each ticker for ticker in tickers: stock_data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date) # Ensure we\u0026#39;re using adjusted close prices stock_data[\u0026#39;Adjusted Price\u0026#39;] = stock_data[\u0026#39;Adj Close\u0026#39;] data[ticker] = stock_data print(f\u0026#34;Downloaded data for {ticker} with adjusted prices\u0026#34;) adj_data = {} for key, value in data.items(): adj_data[key] = value[\u0026#39;Adjusted Price\u0026#39;] df = pd.DataFrame( adj_data ) filepath = os.path.join( download_path,filename ) df.to_csv(filepath) Step #2: Compute daily return # It is worth to mention that when I downloaded the data into the csv file, the data somehow was formatted as text therefore causing problems in subsequent calculation, it may not happen to you. But to show you how I work around it. I save the data from the download csv directly to the worksheet ‘yfinance-downloads’, and I used power query to help me reformat the data.\nIf you would like to use my method, you can copy past the csv data to replace the existing data in the ‘yfinance-downloads’ page, and then, go to Data tab and click Refresh All bottom under Queries and connection section.\nPowerQuery code is here ( in case you are interested). I’ve wrote my own code to make this query dynamic, able to process your custom data, most likely with different table headings (asset tickers) from mine.\n{% raw %} let Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=\u0026#34;Table2\u0026#34;]}[Content], Splitbydelimiter = Table.SplitColumn(Source, \u0026#34;Date\u0026#34;, Splitter.SplitTextByEachDelimiter({\u0026#34; \u0026#34;}, QuoteStyle.Csv, false), {\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Date.2\u0026#34;}), withDates = Table.RemoveColumns(Splitbydelimiter,{\u0026#34;Date.2\u0026#34;}), withoutDates = Table.RemoveColumns(withDates,{\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;}), columnheader = Table.ColumnNames(withoutDates), transform = List.Transform( columnheader, each {_, type number} ), TypeChange = Table.TransformColumnTypes(withDates,transform), TypeChange2 = Table.TransformColumnTypes(TypeChange, {{\u0026#34;Date.1\u0026#34;,type date}}) in TypeChange2 {% endraw %} Step #3 : Using Solver to get the allocation. # Please find instructions in Part 3.\nPart 2 can be more interesting to read for people with certain level of financial knowledge or people come from a mathematical, computer science or engineering background, it is perfectly okay if you want to skip these. It mainly explains the certain choices of approach in the worksheet, such one specific return calculation is used instead of another.\nPart 2: How to measure portfolio performance # Intuitively, we are looking for a system to describe the risks and return properties of a portfolio. One of such system is Mean Variance Analysis.\nHere’s where the magic happens—optimizing your portfolio using some fancy math.\nMean-Variance Optimization # Applying this framework, we formalise the portfolio performances in the following three measures. We use\nExpected return to describe returns Portfolio Variance (or standard deviation) to describe risks Shape Ratio to measure the risk/return trade-off efficiency. It measures how much return you generate for every unit of risk taken. That’s it. Job’s done! Simple right? Now because you asked, I am going to dive a little deeper, only for those there are interested.\nThe standard mathematical formula is provided alongside the matrix algebra version, which is very elegant and efficient for its brevity.\nSee the math formulas Portfolio StatisticsStandard MathMatrix AlgebraAdditional NotesExpected Return E(Rp)=∑i=1nwiE(Ri)E(R_p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)E(Rp​)=∑i=1n​wi​E(Ri​)﻿where: • Rp is the return on the portfolio,• Ri is the return on asset i and• wiw_iwi​﻿ is the weighting of component assetExample with two assetsE⁡(Rp)=wA(RA)+(1−wA)E⁡(RB)E⁡(Rp)=w_A(R_A)+(1−w_A)E⁡(R_B)E⁡(Rp)=wA​(RA​)+(1−wA​)E⁡(RB​)﻿E(Rp)=wTE(R)E(R_p) = w^T E(R)E(Rp​)=wTE(R)﻿where:www﻿ is the column vector of portfolio weights {w1, w2, w3…wn}E(R) is the column vector of expected returnsReturn calculation typically isIn standard formE(Ri)=Pi−Pi−1Pi−1E(R_i)=\\frac{P_i - P_{i-1}}{P_{i-1}}E(Ri​)=Pi−1​Pi​−Pi−1​​﻿However, log normal form is much more popular.

Asset return is not normally distributed. It typically has a fat left tail and think right tail in real world This form is also widely used in derivative market where interest rate compounding period is assumed to be infinite. and you have $ P_0 \\cdot e^{E(R)T} = P_1 $ Discussion #2: Daily Adjusted Closing Price # We used Daily Adjusted Closing Price to calculate returns. Adjustments are carried out to account for stock split, dividends and new issuance.\nDo you need to adjust for inflation? Not necessary. As long as all your prices are consistent and results will also remain consistent.\nDo we need to adjust for FX if I have a multi-currency portfolio? Not necessary. This topic is worth a few posts to explain. For simplicity, because the returns are in percentage turns, as long as the weighting is applied after converting asset values into a common currency, the results will be valid.\nDiscussion #3: Over what period should I run analysis for (Horizon) # In common sense, the backward-looking historical period should be in line with your forward-looking investment horizon. Statistically, a full business cycle period is likely provide more informative and less biased prediction.\nIn our file, a roughly four-year period is used. In order to better predict future returns, select a period that is stationary, ideally cover a business cycle, despite not being essential.\nThis data is provided by Yahoo Finance (through yfinance python module, source code already provided in the file).\nDiscussion #4: Portfolio Variance # This measure captures the variation of returns. This measure has many flaws.\nFirst, Two portfolios with very different return distributions can have similar variances. Only if the return distribution is Normal, then, you can define a unique distribution with Mean and Variance. It is widely observed that asset returns are not perfectly normal. Second, only downward variations in price are considered risks by investors, positive variations in price are not perceived as risks. VaR (Value at Risk) capture only the downside variations therefore can potentially serve as a better alternative. (VaR falls out of the scope of this post.) Discussion #5: Covariance Matrix # Example of Covariance Matrix\n\\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{1}^2 \u0026amp; \\sigma_{12} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{13} \\ \\sigma_{12} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{2}^2 \u0026amp; \\sigma_{23} \\ \\sigma_{13} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{23} \u0026amp; \\sigma_{3}^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\\nVariance is defined as $V(x)=\\frac{1}{N-1}\\Sigma(x_i-μ)^2$ Covariance between two random variables x and y (or columns of a matrix) is defined as $Cov(x,y)= \\frac{1}{N-1} \\Sigma (x_i−μ_x)(y_i−μ_y) $ and $Cov(x,x)=V(x)$\nThe term covariance matrix may be misleading to you. It is not any sort of a special matrix. It is simply set of variances and covariances between pairs of columns. A position of any element in the covariance matrix corresponds to variance/covariance between a pair of two columns, e.g. a number located in 3rd row and 2nd column in the covariance matrix represents covariance between 3rd and 2nd columns of matrix A. $Cov(x,y)=Cov(y,x)$ , therefore covariance matrix is symmetric.\nFor N asset portfolio, you will have N x N covariance matrix.\nAny covariance matrix is symmetric and positive semi-definite and its main diagonal contains variances.\nCovariance matrix can only be calculated through actual underlying price data. Practically, the most used two ways to generate covariance matrix in Excel are\nuse Data Analysis Toolpak (Add-In) to calculate the covariance. use Excel scripting formula In the template file, I used the Excel scripting formula to calculate the covariance matrix. This allows dynamic evaluation (Analysis Toolpak require manual re-do the analysis when you change data) and it also avoids Add-in compatibility issues.\nThis is the fundamental piece of portfolio theory. the covariance matrix captures the potential of diversification among component assets.\nDiversification is arguably the only free lunch in the financial world.\nDiscussion #6: Weighting # We assume you won’t go full \u0026ldquo;Wolf of Wall Street\u0026rdquo; by short-selling. All weights in your portfolio will stay positive. Plus, you’ll invest fully—because letting money sit idle is like letting a treadmill gather dust.\nIn our template file, we specify that each asset must take at least 5% of the portfolio value. This constraints avoids the situation of short selling. And if one can borrow at risk free rate, the portfolio return/return can be further optimised to investor’s advantage. Under that condition, we can even constructing a market portfolio and customised a risk / return profile to investor’s preference. In the future, I will dedicate a post for this topic.\nDiscussion #7: Sharp Ratio # The Sharpe Ratio is like a quick fitness test for your portfolio: How much return are you getting for every unit of risk? Are you taking risks efficiently?\nThe Efficient Frontier is where your portfolio hits the sweet spot—maximizing returns for a given level of risk.\nSharp ratio provides a universal, straightforward and useful concept to compare investment performance based on mean and variance. We subtract a risk-free rate from the portfolio return to separate the riskless and risky portion of returns. Then we compare the return premium to the added risk.\nWe will discuss efficient frontier in a separate post.\nMarkowitz demonstrated that diversification reduces risk so that investors can earn the same return with lower risk, or a higher return for the same risk. He argued that “diversification is the only free lunch in finance.” Investors were urged to diversify across stocks, countries and asset classes.\nTeamwork Makes the Dream Work Think of this as figuring out which assets in your portfolio get along and which are the drama queens. Assets with low or negative covariance balance each other out, reducing your overall risk. If many of assets share similar temper, may god bless you.\nSection Summary # So based on what we discussed above, the next step should be intuitive, we want to maximise the return and minimise the risks based on the portfolio.\nNext, we can leverage the Excel Solver tool to do the leg work and compute an optimal results.\nWe are standing on Giants shoulder\nEconomist Harry Markowitz introduced MPT in a 1952 essay for which he was later awarded a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (Markowitz model).\nThis Mean Variance Optimisation framework is a big thing in Finance and is often mixed with a more significant term, **Modern portfolio theory. (like all significant and difficult-to-understand things in our life, it has an acronym, MPT).**\nPart 3: Solving the Optimisation Problem # This is very simple,\n1. Switching on Solver feature in Excel if it is not on yet. 2. Once enabled, you can find them here Then, go straight to the point!\n3. Configurations Guide Objective: Set this to be the shape ratio, set max as a goal. Changing variables: Select the portfolio weighting array Constraints: based on traditional insights to have set some guideline limits for each portfolio asset, for example, no asset should have a weight that’s 10x time than the smallest asset in the portfolio.

However, the causation direction may be different. It could be that companies with higher profitability simply have more resources to brush up their ESG marketing and practices.\nThis perspective raises the classic statistical pitfall of reverse causation or endogeneity, where it\u0026rsquo;s unclear if ESG practices lead to profitability or if profitability enables stronger ESG initiatives. However, if we focus solely on causation direction, we risk missing the broader point.\nMutually Reinforcing Cycles # There is a type of relationship like this often described as mutually reinforcing or self-reinforcing cycles. In this dynamic, two factors drive each other in a continuous loop, making it difficult (or irrelevant) to determine which is the true origin. Instead of focusing on the \u0026ldquo;first cause,\u0026rdquo; the key is to engage with the cycle to achieve a desired outcome.\nFor example:\nCompanies with strong ESG practices may experience enhanced reputations, customer loyalty, and operational efficiencies that improve profitability. Increased profitability, in turn, provides companies with more resources to further invest in or promote their ESG practices. This cycle creates a feedback loop where both ESG and profitability can grow together, and the origin point becomes less relevant than engaging with the cycle to produce desired results.\nStatistical Testing for Self-Reinforcing Cycles # To analyze this type of relationship, several statistical tests and models are well-suited for examining the reciprocal or cyclical influence of ESG and profitability:\nCross-Lagged Panel Analysis\nThis test uses time-lagged data to analyze if each variable predicts changes in the other over time.\nVector Autoregression (VAR)\nA dynamic model that allows each variable to be expressed as a function of its own past values and the past values of the other variable, revealing potential reinforcement.\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM)\nSEM can help model the complex, bi-directional relationship between ESG and profitability, including indirect effects and latent variables that might influence both.\nGranger Causality Test\nRunning this test in both directions (e.g., from ESG to profitability and vice versa) can provide preliminary insights into whether changes in one precede the other, even if it does not confirm true causation.\nBig Picture Takeaway # Instead of identifying a single cause, the goal is to understand and leverage the ESG-profitability cycle to support a company’s long-term objectives. This perspective encourages a pragmatic approach where the focus shifts to participating in and amplifying the cycle rather than proving which factor is primary. This way, companies can create a sustainable impact that aligns ESG goals with financial performance.\n","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-10-causation-between-esg-and-profitability/","section":"Posts","summary":"LFocus on causation might limit the perspective needed to see the bigger picture.","title":"Causation between ESG and Profitability.","type":"posts"},{"content":" Simplex Method # Used for linear optimization problems Fastest and most reliable for linear models Guaranteed to find the global optimum for linear problems Only works when the Assume Linear Model box is checked1 GRG (Generalized Reduced Gradient) Nonlinear Method # Used for nonlinear optimization problems Can handle smooth, continuous nonlinear functions May find local optima rather than global optima Slower than Simplex but faster than Evolutionary Default method when Assume Linear Model is unchecked1 Works well for problems with continuous derivatives Evolutionary Method # Used for non-smooth or discontinuous problems Can handle discrete variables and non-smooth functions Slowest of the three methods May not find the global optimum, but can often find good solutions for complex problems Useful when other methods fail due to discontinuities or discrete variables Key Considerations # Problem Type: Linear problems should use Simplex.

At the end of this post, I will attach links for my Power BI file. Please note this power BI is receiving updates as I write new posts.\nYou can find the Power BI file here, some screeshots are provided in this post\nAttachment: [241103_AdventureWorks_na.pbix][1]\nKey Idea # Basket analysis using Association Rule, involves understanding purchase patterns over time to see how products relate to each other within a customer’s buying journey. In this approach, each customer is viewed as a \u0026ldquo;basket,\u0026rdquo; meaning we analyze product relationships based on all items they’ve bought, across different orders. The purpose is to find patterns in what customers purchase together, over time, rather than in a single transaction.\nKey metrics, like support, confidence, and lift, are used to understand these product relationships:\nSupport: The percentage of total customers who bought both items. It gives a sense of the prevalence of a combination in the overall population. Confidence: The likelihood that a customer who bought one product also bought another. Lift: The strength of the association between two products. A lift greater than 1 implies a meaningful association that could predict future purchases. For example, if \u0026ldquo;Computers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; frequently appear in a customer’s purchase history, the analysis could reveal that customers who buy \u0026ldquo;Cell phones\u0026rdquo; have a high likelihood of also purchasing \u0026ldquo;Computers,\u0026rdquo; helping companies understand customer preferences and potentially guiding personalized marketing strategies.\nStep 1: Cartesian product of Product with itself # Create a Cartesian product of Product with itself(And Product) on a calculated table and calculate the common customers of each combination\nDEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Both (Internal)] = VAR CustomersWithAndProducts = CALCULATETABLE ( DISTINCT ( Sales[CustomerKey] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ), REMOVEFILTERS ( Sales[ProductKey] ), USERELATIONSHIP ( Sales[ProductKey], \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] ) ) VAR Result = CALCULATE ( [# Customers], KEEPFILTERS ( CustomersWithAndProducts ) ) RETURN Result ------------------------------------------ EVALUATE RawProductsCustomers = FILTER ( SUMMARIZECOLUMNS ( \u0026#39;Sales\u0026#39;[ProductKey], \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey], \u0026#34;Customers\u0026#34;, [# Customers Both (Internal)] ), NOT ISBLANK ( [Customers] ) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Sales\u0026#39;[ProductKey] ) Step 2: Customer Support. # Customer Support has a difficult name, but the idea is “what’s ratio of number of common customers of each combination and total number of customers.”\nDEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Both] = VAR ExistingAndProductKey = CALCULATETABLE ( DISTINCT ( RawProductsCustomers[And ProductKey] ), TREATAS ( DISTINCT ( \u0026#39;And Product\u0026#39;[And ProductKey] ), RawProductsCustomers[And ProductKey] ) ) VAR FilterAndProducts = TREATAS ( EXCEPT ( ExistingAndProductKey, DISTINCT ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39;[ProductKey] ) ), Sales[ProductKey] ) VAR CustomersWithAndProducts = CALCULATETABLE ( SUMMARIZE ( Sales, Sales[CustomerKey] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ), FilterAndProducts ) VAR Result = CALCULATE ( [# Customers], KEEPFILTERS ( CustomersWithAndProducts ) ) RETURN Result ---------------------------------------------------- DEFINE MEASURE [# Customers Total] **=** CALCULATE ( ****[# Customers], ****REMOVEFILTERS ( \u0026#39;Product\u0026#39; ) **)** ---------------------------------------------------- DEFINE MEASURE [% Customers Support] = DIVIDE ( [# Customers Both], [# Customers Total] ) Wait, why this common customer is so mess here. Let’s dive into the measure. The core logic here is to first, get the number of customers in the first list of Products, which is a standard measure [# Basket]. Then, you want to use a list of customers for And Product as a filter to filter this measure. This is called Table Filter technique in DAX, relatively advanced concept in DAX.\nThen the question becomes How to do you get this list of customers for And Product? You first use TREATAS to connect the sales table and And Product table,, once they are connected, you can summarize this sales table (with data lineage) by customers. This technique is called Data Lineage. is a basic concept, however easy to trip over even for advanced DAX users.\nStep 3: Customer Lift. # Customer Lift is nothing complex but a comparison of two ratios. Don’t get fooled by its sophisticated name. This measure is comparing the first ratio we calculated above to a second ratio, “What is the ratio of customers for And Product to total number of customers.\n$ $\\frac{Common customers /total customers}{Product B customers / total customers}$ $ This is saying how much more likely customers are to purchase a product (Product) when they have already bought another related product (And Product)\nCustomers Lift = DIVIDE ( [% Customers Confidence], DIVIDE ( [# Customers And], [# Customers Total] ) ) Attribution # This pattern is included in the book DAX Patterns, Second Edition. by **Alberto Ferrari and Marco Russo. I highly recommend their content. It’s excellent work. They are dedicated DAX teachers with comprehensive DAX knowledge.

First reason is that DAX\u0026rsquo;s advantage in Context Transitions complicated the code from both writer and report readers\u0026rsquo; point of view. Secondly, it is highly likely the data becomes so large that the report runs slow. The Power BI advantages in producing dynamic computation as user consumes the report doesn\u0026rsquo;t really shine in this situation.\nInstead, I find SQL implemtation is really easy to understand.\nSQL Implementation # This is based on schema of SAP Business One with SQL version v10.0 The SalesAnalysis is a replicated view of the SAP stock sales anaysis report.\nCREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[BasketAnalysis] @CardCode NVARCHAR(50) = NULL, @LastNMonth INT = 12 AS BEGIN DECLARE @AssoStartDate DATE = DATEFROMPARTS ( YEAR ( GETDATE()) -2, 1,1) DECLARE @MinRepeatOrd INT = 2 -- Minimal repeated orders that a customer has to place for this item to be considered a regular item of a customer ;

It’s crucial to understand the difference.\nIn the strategy world, the distinction between strategy and planning is well-defined. Strategy is not planning. Strategy is about making hard choices; planning is about organizing actions. ESG’s popularity may partly stem from its planning nature, which promises a single direction—becoming more ethical, responsible, and sustainable. This approach reassures executives in the boardroom. It’s straightforward, and people tend to favor straightforward solutions. Strategy, however, demands a set of coherent, risky choices that allow a business to differentiate itself from competitors, often by deciding not to compete on certain fronts. This is challenging.\nIf companies truly aim for an ESG strategy, rather than mere planning, their focus must be tailored to their current stage of development. This shifts the question for executives from:\n“What parameters are others using to rate companies, and how can we implement actions to score well?”\nto:\n“Which ESG factors matter most to our specific business context? How can we leverage our unique resources and strengths to create meaningful, sustainable impacts for our stakeholders?”\nBy targeting the ESG factors that align with the company’s strengths and position, executives not only build a positive impact that may be harder for competitors to replicate, but they also enhance their strategic position. This approach offers a genuine source of competitive advantage, setting the business apart.\nESG Marketing isn\u0026rsquo;t a Long-term Solution to Corproate Social Responsibility. # While ESG marketing can temporarily bolster a company’s reputation, it lacks the depth and long-term impact of authentic CSR practices and can backfire if the company fails to deliver on its promises.\nEmbracing accountability # ","date":"4 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-10-you-don-t-have-a-esg-strategy/","section":"Posts","summary":"You Don’t Have an ESG Strategy—What You’ve Been Sold Is ESG Planning.","title":"You Don’t Have an ESG Strategy","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/admin/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Admin","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/introduction/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Introduction","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;In an efficient market, prices \u0026lsquo;fully reflect\u0026rsquo; all available information.\u0026rdquo; by Eugene F.
