# Power BI (DAX) Implementation

## Goal

This post is share my experience of developing power bi dashboard. I will find another time to discuss the internal working, data model and other bits around power bi development with you. In this post, I will just share the file with you. You can do whatever you want with this file. 

I taught myself the skills around this work in the last three years, if anything I did in the posts I shared is considered less optimal, I am more than happy to learn from you. Please don't hestate to point out for me! I appreciate that kind guesture.

I couldn't post my work that's done for my last employer because privacy reasons. All the information I shared in this post is purely sourced from internet and you don't need to worry about the patent issues.
